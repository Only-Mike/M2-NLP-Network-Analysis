It shows that current efforts to address food poverty in Africa that focus entirely on small-scale farmers, to the exclusion of broader socio-economic and infrastructural approaches, are misplaced and will remain largely ineffective in ameliorating food and nutrition insecurity for the majority of Africans. Using original data from the African Food Security Urban Network's (AFSUN) extensive database it is demonstrated that the primary food security challenge for urban households is access to food. Already linked into global food systems and value chains, Africa's supply of food is not necessarily in jeopardy. Rather, the widespread poverty and informal urban fabric that characterizes Africa's emerging cities impinge directly on households' capacity to access food that is readily available. Through the analysis of empirical data collected from 6,500 households in eleven cities in nine countries in Southern Africa, the authors identify the complexity of factors and dynamics that create the circumstances of widespread food and nutrition insecurity under which urban citizens live. They also provide useful policy approaches to address these conditions that currently thwart the latent development potential of Africa's expanding urban population. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Bruce Frayne, Jonathan Crush and Cameron McCordic.

In general, third-party logistics (3PL) companies are authorized to handle ESPs, who therefore need to have a good cargo monitoring system in the cold chain environment, without which the functional quality is difficult to control and manage. This may result in product deterioration and even inventory obsolescence of the ESPs due to the lack of such systems, so there is a need to develop an effective cargo monitoring system to prevent such situations. This article proposes an Internet of Things-based cargo monitoring system (IoT-CMS) to monitor any environmental changes of ESPs in order to ensure their functional quality throughout the entire cold chain operational environment. Operational efficiency, maintenance strategy, environmental change, and electricity consumption are considered in real-life cold chain operations. Through applying (i) a wireless sensor network to collect real-time product information, together with (ii) fuzzy logic and case-based reasoning techniques to suggest appropriate storage conditions for various ESPs, effective storage guidance can be established. Through conducting the case study in a 3PL company in Hong Kong, the performance in customer satisfaction, obsolescence rate, and inventory visibility after adoption of IoT-CMS is evaluated. It is found that the functional quality of ESPs can be effectively assured, and the overall customer satisfaction is increased. © The Author(s) 2017.","Cargo monitoring; case-based reasoning; cold chain environment; fuzzy logic; Internet of Things",,"PolyU","Tsang, Y.P.; Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Hung Hom, Hong Kong; email: p.tsang@connect.polyu.hk","SAGE Publications Inc.",18479790,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039850983

Box 3000, Oulu, FI-90014, Finland","Consumers and institutional kitchens, as well as traders, have shown increasing interest towards local food. This is particularly due to the transparency and traceability characteristic of a short supply chain and social aspects related to food origins. The trend has been increasingly common during the past decade in Europe and North America, and it is strongly evident in the case area of this study in Northern Ostrobothnia, Finland. In general, ease of access to food is highly important for consumers and crucial for institutional kitchens, in addition to quality aspects and price. However, regardless of proximity, poor accessibility is one of the key issues preventing the further growth of local food markets. Due to scale economics in food value chain, food transport is presently organised mainly by centralised, large-scale logistics companies directed via hubs serving millions of consumers. Accordingly, production volumes required to enter large-scale markets are often unattainable for disjointed small-scale local food producers. In this study, geographic information system (GIS)-based accessibility analyses are applied for analysing potential for integral networking of local food production and transport companies. Berry production was selected as a case study because it has a relatively strong role in Northern Ostrobothnia, while its logistics are notably underdeveloped. Spatial data of primary production volumes consists of register records of farm-specific cultivation areas and average yields in Northern Ostrobothnia and Finland. Accessibility computations are based on the digital model of the Finnish road network, Digiroad. Two surveys were also implemented to farmers and food processing companies to seek views on food processing, sales, logistics and procurements regarding local food. Data from the surveys was used in accessibility analysis, which enables exploration of opportunities for establishing 'local food' clusters integrating small producers into a more effective and competitive network. Information about favourable conditions for cooperative networks in the local food sector may help in establishing companies and their growth. Again, successful networking may increase scale economies in local production in transport, processing and marketing. © by Kirsi Korhonen 2018.","accessibility; berry production; Finland; geographic information systems (GIS); local food; location allocation; Northern Ostrobothnia","accessibility; agricultural economics; food market; food processing; food production; food supply; fruit production; GIS; supply chain management; Finland; North America; Pohjois-Pohjanmaa","",,"Walter de Gruyter GmbH",18038417,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041059781

In the present worldwide market, well-managed supply chain is a standout amongst the most vital requirement to be more competitive in the market. For any organization incorporate cement industry, the most critical decision in initial process of supply chain management is to buy products, materials or services from suppliers. So the role of suppliers is irrefutable important in the global aggressive markets. Appropriate decision of supplier selection can lead to reducing cost in supply chain management. However, it is becoming more complex because of existing various criteria and involving the suitable experts in the company to make valid decision in accordance with its criteria. In this study, the supplier selection of an Indonesia's leading cement company is analyzed by using one of the popular multi-criteria decision making method, Saaty's analytical network process (ANP). It is employed for the selection of the best alternative among three suppliers of pasted bag. Supplier with the highest rank comes from several major steps from building the relationship between various criteria to rating the alternatives with the help of experts from the company. The results show that, Communication capability, Flexible payment terms, Ability to meet delivery quantities are the most important criteria in the pasted bag supplier selection in Indonesian cement industry with 0.155, 0.110 and 0.1 ANP coefficient respectively. And based on the ANP coefficient values in limit supermatrix, the A2 or supplier 2 had the highest score with 64.7% or 0.13 ANP coefficient. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","ANP; multi criteria decision making; supplier selection; supply chain management","Cement industry; Cements; Commerce; Decision making; Industrial management; Planning; Sustainable development; Analytical network process; Analytical network processes (ANP); Coefficient values; Communication capabilities; Initial process; Multi criteria decision making; Multi-criteria decision making methods; Supplier selection; Supply chain management",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing",17578981,,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039755236

Indeed, companies may need to keep some information about their business operations secret. In this paper, we propose a solution that enables selective sharing of data collected along a supply chain.

All SNs have no embedded energy supply and thus need to perform EH before transmitting their data to the HAP. Thanks to the FD capability, the HAP simultaneously receives data from the scheduled SN in the uplink and broadcasts energy-bearing signals to charge other SNs in the downlink. Considering that the EH SNs may not be able to perform effective channel estimation, we develop a new energy status-based multi-user scheduling scheme for the considered system. In the proposed scheme, a single SN with the maximum weighted residual energy is selected to transmit information to the HAP, while all other SNs are scheduled to harvest and accumulate energy. The weight factor of each SN is determined by its average channel quality and the required transmission rate. To evaluate the system performance, we model the dynamic energy charging and discharging processes of each SN as a finite-state Markov chain (MC). The Newton method is applied to achieve the steady state distributions of these mutually coupled MCs. An analytical expression of the system outage probability is derived over Rician fading channels. Simulations are performed to validate the theoretical analysis and illustrate the merits of the proposed user scheduling scheme. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Fading channels; Finite difference method; Markov processes; Newton-Raphson method; Scheduling; Signal processing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Analytical expressions; Discharging process; Full duplex wireless; Multiuser scheduling; Rician fading channel; Steady-state distributions; System outage probability; Wireless-powered communications; Energy harvesting",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509030088,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044218979

Executing effective warehouse site selection has been one of the key challenges in the development of a successful supply chain system. While some effective strategies for warehouse site selection have been identified by the domain experts based on their experiences, the emergence of new ways of collecting fine-grained supply chain data has enabled a new paradigm for warehouse site selection. Indeed, in this paper, we provide a data-smart approach for addressing the connected capacitated warehouse location problem (CCWL), which searches for the minimum total transportation cost of the warehouse network including supplier-warehouses shipping cost, warehouse-customer delivering cost and the cost of warehouse-warehouse inter-transportation. Specifically, we first design a sales distribution prediction model and evaluate the importance of customer logistic service utilities on online market sales demand for online retailers. Then, we propose the E&M algorithm to optimize warehouse locations continuously with much less computation cost. Moreover, the computation cost is further reduced through delivery demand based Hierarchical Clustering which reduces the problem size by grouping delivering cities with close locations. Finally, we validate the proposed method on real-world e-Commerce supply chain data and the selection effect of new warehouses is evaluated in terms of sales improvement with faster delivery and more effective inventory management. © 2017 IEEE.","Clustering; Demand Prediction; E-commerce; Site Selection","Chains; Commerce; Costs; Data mining; Electronic commerce; Inventory control; Location; Sales; Supply chain management; Warehouses; Clustering; Demand prediction; Hier-archical clustering; Inventory management; Sales distributions; Supply chain systems; Transportation cost; Warehouse location problems; Site selection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15504786,9781538638347,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043979474

As holders of WEEE, consumers have a significant effect on the recycling process. A consideration of and attention to the influence of consumer behavior in the recycling process can help achieve more effective recycling of WEEE. In this paper, we built a dual-channel closed-loop supply chain model composed of manufacturers, retailers, and network recycling platforms. Based on the influence of customer bargaining behavior, we studied several different scenarios of centralized decision-making, decentralized decision-making, and contract coordination, using the Stackelberg game theory. The results show that retailers and network recycling platforms will reduce the direct recovery prices to maintain their own profit when considering the impact of consumer bargaining behavior, while remanufacturers will improve the transfer payment price for surrendering part of the profit under revenue and the expense sharing contract. Using this contract, we can achieve supply chain coordination and eliminate the effect of consumer bargaining behavior on supply chain performance.

Eco-labelling informs consumers of specific characteristics of products and has been used to market greener products. Eco-labelling in the food industry has yet been mostly focused on promoting organic farming, limiting the scope to the agricultural stage of the supply chain, while carbon labelling informs on the carbon footprint throughout the life cycle of the product. These labelling strategies help value products in the eyes of the consumer. Because of this, decision makers are motivated to adopt more sustainable models. In the food industry, this has led to important environmental impact improvements at the agricultural stage, while most other stages in the Food Supply Chain (FSC) have continued to be designed inefficiently. The objective of this work is to define a framework showing how carbon labelling can be integrated into the design process of the FSC. For this purpose, the concept of Green Supply Chain Network Design (GSCND) focusing on the strategic decision making for location and allocation of resources and production capacity is developed considering operational, financial and environmental (CO2 emissions) issues along key stages in the product life cycle. A multi-objective optimization strategy implemented by use of a genetic algorithm is applied to a case study on orange juice production. The results show that the consideration of CO2 emission minimization as an objective function during the GSCND process together with techno-economic criteria produces improved FSC environmental performance compared to both organic and conventional orange juice production. Typical results thus highlight the importance that carbon emissions optimization and labelling may have to improve FSC beyond organic labelling. Finally, CO2 emission-oriented labelling could be an important tool to improve the effects eco-labelling has on food product environmental impact going forward. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Eco-labels; Food industry; Green supply chain network design; Multi-objective optimization; Organic labels","carbon; agricultural practice; alternative agriculture; carbon footprint; decision making; environmental impact; experimental design; food industry; food processing; genetic algorithm; industrial production; optimization; performance assessment; supply chain management; sustainability; Article; carbon footprint; environmental impact; food industry; genetic algorithm; orange juice; organic farming; sustainable agriculture; agriculture; carbon footprint; catering service; food chain; organic farming; Agriculture; Carbon Footprint; Food Chain; Food Supply; Organic Agriculture","SEP; FP7: 288974; MOE; CONACYT","Miranda-Ackerman, M.A.; CONACYT-El Colegio de Michoacán, Cerro de Nahuatzen 85, Fracc, Jardines del Cerro Grande, Mexico; email: mamiranda@conacyt.mx","Academic Press",03014797,,JEVMA,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019885063

Does your firm set specific cost-reduction objectives for its suppliers? Does your firm help its customers and/or suppliers find ways to achieve their cost-education objectives? Does your firm take into account the profitability of its suppliers when negotiating component pricing with them? Is your firm continuously making its buyer-supplier interfaces more efficient? If the answer to any of these questions is ""no"", your firm risks introducing products that cost too much or are not competitive. The full potential of the supply network can be realized only when the entire supply chain adopts interorganizational cost management practices. Competitive pressure has led many firms to try to increase the efficiency of supplier firms through interorganizational cost management systems, a structured approach to coordinating the activities of firms in a supplier network to reduce the total costs in the network. It is particularly important to lean enterprises for two reasons: Lean enterprises typically outsource more of the added value of their products than their mass producer counterparts. Lean enterprises usually compete more aggressively and must manage costs more effectively. Interorganizational cost management can reduce costs in three ways: through product design, through product manufacture and through cooperative approaches between buyers and suppliers to build smoother interfaces. However, more than just cost management must cross interorganizational boundaries. Suppliers are also a major source of innovation for lean enterprises. Successful supplier networks encourage every firm in the network to innovate and compete more aggressively.

The goal of our research was to optimize a cost function that depends on RFID system viscosity. The viscosity of the RFID can be defined as the flow of data through the RFID network. This process can be measured by the entropy of the parking and forwarding of the signal, leading to a sustainable supply chain system. The dynamics of this system are governed by differential equations. Using this entropy model, we verified the integrated supply chain health manufacturing system risk failure reduction via simulation. Our method employs a fuzzy Kalman filter, improves the system, reduces backorders and demonstrates that RFID viscosity is an effective means to this end.

While many analyses emphasise its 'criminal' and 'illegal' nature, less attention has been paid to the ambiguity of this economy, most prominently incarnated by the intermediate mineral traders called négociants. Focusing on their entrepreneurship, networks and everyday activities, this essay offers a more nuanced understanding of local mineral trade in the context of a 'crisis economy' framed by competing governable orders. It investigates the uncertainty along eastern DRC's mineral supply chains, that are undergoing major regulatory changes to curb the trade of so-called 'conflict minerals'.

While high-quality, prehospital trauma care is crucial to reduce the number of trauma-related deaths, effective Emergency Medical Systems (EMS) are limited or absent in many LMICs. Although lay providers have long been recognized as the front lines of informal trauma care in countries without formal EMS, few efforts have been made to capitalize on these networks. We suggest that lay providers can become a strong foundation for nascent EMS through a four-fold approach: strengthening and expanding existing lay provider training programs; incentivizing lay providers; strengthening locally available first aid supply chains; and using technology to link lay provider networks. © World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine 2017.","Emergency Medical Services; traffic accidents; under-developed countries","cause of death; developing country; emergency health service; first aid; middle income country; public health; review; traffic accident; training; caregiver; developing country; emergency health service; health care delivery; health care planning; human; manpower; public health service; United States; Caregivers; Developing Countries; Emergency Medical Services; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Medically Underserved Area; United States; United States Public Health Service",,"Debenham, S.; University of Utah, 4657 S.

In particular the transport industry is still considered as a large polluter. Therefore, stakeholders put pressure on the industry to work on their environmental footprint. Shippers assess whether their supply chain as a whole can be increasingly 'greened', given increasing environmental awareness from both customers (in B2B settings) and consumers (in B2C settings). Ports, as important nodes in transport networks, seek to respond to these pressures. However, their variety of geographical location, economic situation, governance structures and administrative heritage would suggest different preferences towards environmental initiatives. This paper discusses the results of a multiple case study analysis, based on desk research and in-depth interviews with seven port authorities within the Hamburg-Le Havre range. The main goal was to investigate how port authorities respond towards the challenge of greening the shipping industry, in particular on the motives and rationale behind the set-up of pricing schemes, and what kind of institutional arrangements are installed. From an institutional theory perspective, a high degree of isomorphism is observed in the Hamburg-Le Havre range as these ports are focusing mainly on Environmental Shipping Index (ESI) based bonus schemes for environmental differentiated port infrastructure pricing. Managerial and policy implications/ recommendations, based on the empirical results of the cross-case study, are formulated in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the use of environmental differentiated charging schemes. © 2017 Gruppo Editoriale Internazionale Srl.

First, we integrate ET and AHP in order to include several criteria (social, economical, and environmental) and the uncertain experts decisions for selecting the best set of facilities. Second, we combine evidential data mining and TSSP approach: (i) to design the SCN, (ii) to take into account the uncertainty of supply chain parameters, and (iii) to reduce scenarios number by retaining only the significant ones.

Our benchmark of GeH FETs against similar devices based on 2D materials reveals that GeH outperforms MoS2 and black phosphorus in terms of energy-delay product (EDP). In addition, the performance of GeH-based CMOS circuit is analyzed using an inverter chain. By engineering power supply voltage and threshold voltage simultaneously, we find the optimal operating condition of GeH FETs, minimizing EDP in the CMOS circuit.

Companies therefore strive to implement effective and integrated sustainable supply chain management initiatives to improve their operational and economic performance while also minimizing unnecessary damage to the environment and maintaining their social reputation and images. The paper presents an easy-to-use decision-support approach based on multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodologies that aim to help companies develop effective models for timely decision-making involving sustainable supply chain management strategies. The proposed approach can be used by practitioners to ultimately build a comprehensive Analytic Network Process model that will adequately capture and reveal all the interrelationships and interdependency among the elements in the problem, which is often a very difficult task. To facilitate and simplify this complex process, we propose that hierarchical thinking be used first to structure the essences of the problem capturing only the major issues, and an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model be built. Users can learn from the modeling process and gain much insight into the problem. The AHP can then be extended to an Analytic Network Process (ANP) model so as to capture the relationships and interdependencies among the elements. Our approach can reduce the sustainable expertise, effort and information that are often needed to build an ANP model from scratch. We apply our approach to the evaluation of sustainable supply chain management strategies for the fashion industry. Three main dimensions of sustainability—environmental, economic and social—are considered. Based on the literature, we identified four alternative supply chain management strategies. It was found that the Reverse Logistics alternative appears to be the recommended solution by the AHP model. However, the Socially Leagile Supply Chain is recommended by the ANP model, thereby demonstrating the necessity and importance of considering interdependencies in the model. © 2017 by the authors.

However, occurrence of disruptions such as food, earthquake and fire could ruin performance of supply chains. Uncertainty of parameters is another important factor that could lower quality of long-Term plans of companies. Hence, uncertainty of parameters and disruption strike are important issues adversely influencing reliability of networks. Also, responsiveness of supply chains is a significant matter that should be considered carefully while designing distribution networks. Responsiveness could increase customer loyalty and satisfaction that could result in increasing market share of companies and their long-Term planned benefit. Regarding alluded matters, the aim of this paper is designing a reliable forwardreverse supply chain network that minimizes total costs of network design along with maximization of total responsiveness of distribution network. Extended closed-loop network is capable of considering environmental issues by caring about end-of-life products. Designing reverse supply chain network aside with forward ones could decrease bad environmental impact of end-of-life products. Notably, to cope with adverse effects of disruptions, a scenario-based approach is suggested that enables considering partial and complete disruption of capacity of facilities. Additionally, an effective possibilistic programming method is applied to appropriately control uncertainty of parameters. As quality of raw materials is important to produce high-quality products, minimum acceptable quality level of raw materials is considered in extended model to maximize customer satisfaction. Finally, it should be noted that designed test problems show appropriate performance of suggested model and its applicability in real world case studies. Extended model is solved regarding different risk-Aversion levels and sensitivity analysis is performed for different parameters of network design that shows effectual performance of proposed model. © World Scientific Publishing Company.","Network design; Possibilistic programming; Reliability; Responsiveness; Supply chain","Competition; Customer satisfaction; Electric power distribution; Environmental impact; Reliability; Risk assessment; Sales; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Acceptable quality levels; Closed-loop supply chain network designs; High-quality products; Network design; Possibilistic programming; Reliability of supply; Responsiveness; Reverse supply chains; Product design",,"Hamidieh, A.; Department of Industrial Engineering, Iran; email: hamidieh@tpnu.ac.ir","World Scientific Publishing Co.

Steven Kenny of Axis Communications argues that it's time to look at all stages of the production and selling of Internet-connected devices, with everyone involved shouldering some of the responsibility for making sure we stay safe. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"Denial-of-service attack; Digital devices; Remote control; Supply chains; Digital recorders; Distributed denial of service attack; Replay attack; Network security",,,"Elsevier Ltd",13613723,,CFSBE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038104730

These changes may not only affect the product's bill of material, but also its supply chain network. Consequently, new supply chain costs are generated. This paper addresses the problem of supply chain configuration considering new product re-design using a multi-Agent system (MAS). The objective of the system is to ensure good collaboration between two different points of view, supply chain partners and product designers, to make better decisions. To model the proposed system, we select the multi-Agent system engineering (MaSe) methodology. The MAS framework contains three types of agents, namely, \product design agent"" and \supply chain agents"" which are fitted with optimization tools. These tools allow costs' optimization and selection of supply chain means (suppliers, technologies, etc.). Finally, the system contains a \communication agent"" acting like a mediator; it facilitates data exchange between designers. To support distributed decision-making, two models of mixed integer linear programming are adopted and implemented within the framework for supply chain optimization. The overall MAS approach was tested in simulation with a case study. The objective of the simulation is to choose among three product alternatives the cheapest one based on its supplying and production costs, under capacity constraints. The MAS was able to find the best product alternative among three alternatives proposed by product design team and select optimal supply chain means. The optimal supply chain contains two suppliers: one machine and one subcontractor to satisfy customer's demand. © World Scientific Publishing Company.","Multi-Agent system; New product re-design; Supply chain conguration","Costs; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Decision support systems; Electronic data interchange; Integer programming; Life cycle; Multi agent systems; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Decision support tools; Distributed decision making; Mixed integer linear programming; Optimal supply chain; Supply chain configuration; Supply chain network; Supply chain optimization; Supply chain partners; Product design",,"Ballouki, I.; Department of Industrial Engineering and Production, B.P. 15290 El Mansour, Morocco; email: imane.ballouki@gmail.com","World Scientific Publishing Co.

In this paper, supply chain network simulator is developed, as a replacement for the traditional board Beer Game. The board Beer Game could be misused by participants in order to avoid significant bullwhip effect, which occurrence is the Beer Game main aim. The disadvantage of the board Beer Game, that participants have insight in inventory levels and placed orders and thus strategically act upon their knowledge or even activate a sort of decentralized information sharing policy, is avoided. Further considerations prove the mandatory occurrence of bullwhip effect without decentralized information sharing policy on three case studies. Optimal mathematical model for placing orders within a supply chain was defined according to multi-criteria optimization process using spreadsheet simulation. As even optimal model results with the bullwhip effect, newly developed system will always lead to the tremendous bullwhip effect during the learning process. © 2017 DAAAM International Vienna.

While scholars often focus on the political gains from these new forms of business organization, we shift the conversation to the potential political costs of global firm reorganization. The spread of corporate subsidiaries and global supply-chain networks leave firms vulnerable to a host of jurisdictional claims, and by targeting a domestically rooted affiliate, states can bring the global practices of the multinational corporation in line with their interests. In other words, states can take advantage of the transnationalization of the firm to transnationalize their authority beyond traditional jurisdictional boundaries. We label this process “networked liabilities.” Specifically, the combination of a firm’s sunk costs and the country’s jurisdictional substitutability determines the ability of governments to exert demands on multinational corporations. A key contribution of the article is to better specify the relationship between mobility and authority and to illustrate that networked liabilities can further empower a variety of states beyond traditional economic powers like the US or the European Union. We further highlight when firms may curtail the authority of great powers. The growing reach of the regulatory state domestically, coupled with the transnationalization of the firm, creates an increasing number of tools for certain governments to engage in economic statecraft beyond their borders. Our findings, then, contribute to debates on business–government relations in a globalized world, the changing nature of political risk, and the deterritorialization of state authority. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Business–government; extraterritoriality; political risk; regulatory state; supply chains; transnational authority",,,"Newman, A.; Intercultural Center (ICC) 681, 37th and O Streets, N.W, United States; email: aln24@georgetown.edu","SAGE Publications Ltd",13540661,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035780789

In this article, a model is proposed to optimise container flows between two continents via an end-to-end service. The model is concerned not only with the design of an optimal shipping route but also with inland connections between hinterlands and ports. The objective is to minimise total costs, consisting of ship costs, port costs, inland/feeder transport costs, inventory costs and CO2 costs. The model is applied to the actual trade between Europe and the United States. Computational outcomes show that ship costs and port costs (port dues and terminal handling charges) represent less than one third of total costs. Therefore, the maritime network is only a part of a bigger system and piecemeal optimisation may not guarantee the optimisation of the whole network. Inland/feeder transport costs contribute the most to total costs, and they are influenced significantly by port choice. Although the use of a greater number of ports results in longer distances and higher shipping costs, this benefits in terms of lower distribution costs between hinterlands and ports. Inventory costs play a considerable part in total costs and they increase as vessel capacity goes up. In other words, these costs present a barrier to the introduction of bigger vessels. Optimal size is obviously a trade-offs between inventory and shipping costs. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","environmental costs; global supply chains; inventory costs; liner shipping; mega vessels; route design",,"",,"Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.",14792931,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033490192

This work proposes a flexible supply chain network design (SCND) model that uses generalized production/warehousing nodes instead of individual production plants and warehouses while conquers with demand uncertainty using a scenario-based approach. It also deals with inventory management and decisions on strategical and tactical level (facility location, production rate, warehouse capacity, demand allocation between generalized nodes, inventory levels, product flows, suppliers’ product availability and links between all facilities). The proposed Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model allows intra-layer flows between generalized nodes and aims at minimizing total network cost. A case study is formed to test the applicability of the model for a medium sized European company. A comparison was made between a classic supply chain network and generalized network that deals with uncertainty. Results have revealed cost benefits for this model, making it not only applicable, but also cost effective for the company that will apply it.

In this process, the aforementioned dimensions are extended and integrated in mathematical modeling framework. The research modeling is compared with traditional approaches, which merely rely on operational dimension to optimize profit and due to problems in profit, the research objectives changed to the multiple objectives of corporate value, change in equity and economic value added. Within this framework, a comparison is primarily made between profit and each of corporate value, change in equity and economic value added two by two (in the form of traditional approach (scenario A) and new approach (scenario B)). Then the objectives are simultaneously assessed and a compromise is gained among them through fuzzy goal programming. In this process, the effectiveness and efficiency of the scenario B is analyzed and assessed. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed on such factors as demand, return of equity rate, tax rate, production capacity and supplier capacity while the impacts of their changes on multi-objective function and satisfaction coefficient are simultaneously calculated. The mathematical model in the study is multi-product and multi-period while the values of parameters are determined under definite circumstances. For modeling and solving the mathematical model, GAMS 24 software and CPLEX solver are employed. To test the model, data of an Iranian petrochemical company are used.

Currently, implementation of sustainability in supply chain has been continuously in center of attention due to introducing stringent legislations regarding environmental pollution by various governments and increasing stakeholders’ concerns toward social injustice. Unfortunately, literature is still scarce on studies considering all three dimensions (economical, environmental and social) of sustainability for the supply chain. An effective supply chain network design (SCND) is very important to implement sustainability in supply chain. This study proposes an uncertain SCND model that minimizes the total supply chain-oriented cost and determines the opening of plants, warehouses and flow of materials across the supply chain network by considering various carbon emissions and social factors. In this study, a new AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS-based methodology is proposed to transform qualitative social factors into quantitative social index, which is subsequently used in chance-constrained SCND model with an aim at reducing negative social impact. Further, the carbon emission of supply chain is estimated by considering a composite emission that consists of raw material, production, transportation and handling emissions. In the model, a carbon emission cap is imposed on total supply chain to reduce the carbon footprint of supply chain. To solve the proposed model, a code is developed in AMPL software using a nonlinear solver SNOPT. The applicability of the proposed model is illustrated with a numerical example. The sensitivity analysis examines the effects of reducing carbon footprint cap, negative social impacts and varying probability on the total cost of the supply chain. It is observed that a stricter carbon cap over supply chain network leads to opening of more plants across the supply chain. In addition, carbon footprint of supply chain is found to be decreased in certain extent with the reduction in negative social impacts from suppliers. The carbon footprint of the supply chain is found to be reduced with increasing certainty of material supply from the suppliers. The total supply chain cost is observed to be augmented with increasing probability. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Carbon footprint; Chance-constrained programming; Social sustainability; Stochastic programming; Supply chain network design; Sustainability","Computer programming; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Materials handling; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Chance-constrained; Chance-constrained programming; Environmental pollutions; Social sustainability; Supply chain costs; Supply chain network; Supply chain network design; Two stage approach; Carbon footprint",,"Shaw, K.; Department of Management Studies, India; email: shawkrishnendu@gmail.com","Springer Verlag",1618954X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032790854

The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture. Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices. The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes, predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network. The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT.

In order to ensure the optimal performance of the supply chain, enable continuous improvement and create competitive advantage, establishment of a performance evaluation system is essential. For this purpose, the current study proposes a Network Data Envelopment Analysis (NDEA) model for measuring efficiency of four-stage serial network of blood supply chain in presence of feedback variables by identifying comprehensive and balanced criteria as evaluation variables. Since criteria values are obtained from subjective judgment of individuals, are uncertain. Interval Eviden Reasoning (IER) approach that deals with a variety of uncertainties such as ignorance and vagueness, has been used to control the uncertainty and provide reliable evaluation. In order to rank the units a new cross-efficiency based model is presented as a remedy for the issue of non-uniqueness of optimal weights in cross efficiency. Then, Gibbs entropy is utilized to measure the uncertainty of obtained interval cross efficiency. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed model. © 2017, American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

However, with a few exceptions, there has been little criminological research conducted on the trade’s actors and organisation. Of the few studies that are available, most position the supply of these products in the context of ‘transnational organised crime’, often presupposing the overwhelming presence of large-scale, hierarchical structures in the trade. This article, based on two extensive research projects in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, offers an account of the illicit supply of medicines in two European jurisdictions. The research outlines the nature and dynamics of the trade including the roles played by each national context as nodes in the global supply chain. The focus then shifts to the modus operandi, actors, online trade and social organisation in both countries. In contradistinction to the ‘transnational organised crime’ narrative, the empirical data outlined in this paper demonstrates that actors and networks involved in the trade are highly flexible and complex structures that straddle the categories of licit and illicit, online and offline, and global and local. This suggests that operations supplying illicit medicines vary largely in terms of size, reach, organisation and legality. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Counterfeit medicines; Enhancement drugs; Illicit medicines; Online markets; Organised crime",,"EC: HOME/2011/ISEC/ AG/FINEC/4000002221","Hall, A.; School of Social Sciences, United Kingdom; email: Alexandra.Hall@tees.ac.uk","Springer New York LLC",10844791,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030847046

The reduction of food waste impacts positively all three dimensions of sustainability (economic, social, and environmental). Thirty-three challenges inhibiting reduction of waste in AFSC are identified by a review of the literature and a consultation with experts in the Indian food industry and academia. These challenges are grouped using Exploratory Factor Analysis into a super-set of nine challenges. The inter-relationship and respective dominance among these nine challenges is then determined using Interpretive Structural Modelling and MICMAC analysis. The group of independent challenges (food characteristics, supply chain uncertainty, market infrastructure, and food policy and regulation) have higher driving power and low dependency, and require maximum attention. These four challenges constrain decisions at the three-decision-making echelon (strategic, tactical, and operational) and each of the supply-chain echelons. The group of dependent challenges (supply chain partnerships, operational capability, and supply chain networks) have high dependence and low driving power and are resultant effects. The challenge, information technology, with high driving and dependence power, is a linkage variable. It acts as an enabler of dependent variables, and it mitigates the complexities due to food characteristics and uncertainty. The challenge, consumer behaviour, with low driving and dependence power, is an autonomous variable. It has little influence on waste reduction in Indian AFSC.

We present an integrated modeling framework for configuring a distribution system with reverse flows so as to minimize the total cost of satisfying customer demand and remanufacturing the returned items that are recoverable. Given a set of existing plants and customer zones, our basic model identifies the optimal number and location of distribution centers and return centers assuming that all plants have remanufacturing capability. We devise a Lagrangian heuristic for this problem. The proposed solution method proved to be computationally efficient for solving large-scale instances of the closed-loop supply chain design problem. The potential benefits of the integrated model are demonstrated by comparing its results with those obtained from an alternative approach that determines optimal forward and reverse network structures sequentially. We also extend the basic model to determine the optimal locations for establishing remanufacturing facilities. Using the extended model, we study the conditions under which the return centers can be co-located with remanufacturing facilities rather than being established at the downstream echelons of the supply chain. Different from the existing works on facility location-allocation models for closed-loop supply chain network design, the main focus in this paper is on the investigation of structural properties of the network such as co-locating return centers with remanufacturing facilities and quantifying the benefit of modeling forward and reverse flows simultaneously rather than sequentially. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Facility location-allocation; Lagrangian relaxation; Mixed-integer programming model; Reverse logistics",,"TÜBITAK","Aras, N.; Department of Industrial Engineering, Turkey; email: arasn@boun.edu.tr","SpringerOpen",2210464X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030557767

This paper focuses in the A I waste wood since is the only category able to be used directly for both material and energy purposes without a previously pre-treatment. Currently, most of this waste wood is used for direct energy production due to the previous government legislation that promoted its use directly in incineration facilities. However, the newest Renewable Energy Act (EEG 2017) may promote the cascade-use of A I waste wood prior to be intended for energy purposes. Nonetheless, the government incentives to the energy sector is not the only bottleneck that the use of A I waste wood as raw material in the wood-based industry has to overcome. The peak availability, collection logistics (collection centers and transportation) and recycling facility location are some of the parameters that must be considered in order to design the “best” supply chain network for A I waste wood.

However, precise control of product specificity is still greatly challenged by the substrate promiscuity of the ketoacid decarboxylase, which unselectively hijacks ketoacid intermediates from the elongation cycle along with the target ketoacid. In this work, preferential tuning of the Lactococcus lactis ketoisovalerate decarboxylase (Kivd) specificity toward 1-pentanol synthesis was achieved via saturated mutagenesis of the key residue V461 followed by screening of the resulting alcohol spectrum. Substitution of V461 with the small and polar amino acid glycine or serine significantly improved the Kivd selectivity toward the 1-pentanol precursor 2-ketocaproate by lowering its catalytic efficiency for the upstream ketoacid 2-ketobutyrate and 2-ketovalerate. Conversely, replacing V461 with bulky or charged side chains displayed severely adverse effect. Increasing supply of the iterative addition unit acetyl-CoA by acetate feeding further drove 2-ketoacid flux into the elongation cycle and enhanced 1-pentanol productivity. The Kivd V461G variant enabled a 1-pentanol production specificity around 90% of the total alcohol content with or without oleyl alcohol extraction. This work adds insight to the selectivity of Kivd active site. © The Author(s) 2017.",,"acetic acid; alcohol derivative; carboxylyase; n-pentanol; oxoacid; pentanol; chemistry; codon; gene expression; genetic variation; genetics; metabolism; molecular model; mutagenesis; protein conformation; Acetates; Alcohols; Carboxy-Lyases; Codon; Gene Expression; Genetic Variation; Keto Acids; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Models, Molecular; Mutagenesis; Pentanols; Protein Conformation","MICYT: 105-2622-8-007-009","Shen, C.R.; Department of Chemical Engineering, Taiwan; email: crshen@mx.nthu.edu.tw","Nature Publishing Group",20452322,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029353406

Here we present the Chatham House Maritime Analysis Tool (CH-MAT), which estimates the volume and value of staple foods passing through maritime chokepoints.

The value of the CH-MAT is illustrated by a first assessment of global flows via maritime chokepoints. We discuss how such data can be combined with information on inland and overland transport networks, strategic reserves and environmental change, to enhance understanding of the risks associated with disruption to critical infrastructure – owing to weather events, trade restrictions, conflict, congestion, or institutional failures.

A number of efforts have been devoted to define SCRR or to develop risk mitigation strategies for their improvement. However, a key question remaining to be answered is how SCRR should be quantified. Existing methods are insufficient in addressing this question on two important fronts: First, they do not adequately represent the interdependencies between different supply chain nodes; second, they do not allow for the modeling of actionable decisions and thus cannot be used to guide improvement strategies. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a unified framework for evaluating SCRR that internalizes design inputs and is flexible to varying degrees of data availability. The proposed framework captures risks involved in the supply, the demand, the firm itself, and the external environment. It also contributes to the literature by relating SCRR to the supply chain’s risk-mitigating capabilities prior to or postdisruptions. A novel method using the supply chain’s inherent buyer–supplier relationships is designed to model node interdependencies. Two example applications are discussed to demonstrate how this framework can be utilized to assist in reliable and resilient supply chain design. © 2017 IEEE.","Bayesian methods; Design; Reliability; Resilience; Supply chain management; Supply chain risk propagation; System analysis","Bayesian networks; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Reliability theory; Risk management; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Bayesian methods; Complexity theory; Reliability engineering; resilience; Supply chain risk; System analysis and design; Risk assessment","U-M","Chen, X.; Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering, United States; email: xichenxi@umich.edu","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00189529,,IEERA,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028729578

The proposed optimization models aim to enhance supply network performance with a smaller overall investment. Toward this aim, three research hypotheses on optimization of supply decisions and configurations are developed and tested.

One challenge in VMI is that both the vendor and buyer are manufacturers who try to achieve an inventory as small as possible or even a zero inventory; it is therefore difficult to manage inventory coordination between them. This paper considers a decentralized VMI problem in a three-echelon supply chain network in which multiple distributors (third-party logistics companies) are selected to balance the inventory between a vendor (manufacturer) and multiple buyers (manufacturers). To handle this issue, this paper first proposes a tri-level decision model to describe the decentralized VMI problem, which allows us to examine how decision members coordinate with each other in respect of decentralized VMI decision-making in a predetermined sequence. We then turn our attention to the geometry of the solution space and present a vertex enumeration algorithm to solve the resulting tri-level decision model. Lastly, a computational study is developed to illustrate how the proposed tri-level decision model and solution approach can handle the decentralized VMI problem. The results indicate that the proposed tri-level decision-making techniques provide a practical way to design a novel manufacturer-manufacturer (vendor-buyer) VMI system where third-party logistics are involved. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Multilevel decision-making; Supply chain management; Tri-level decision-making; Vendor-managed inventory; Vertex enumeration algorithm","Inventory control; Manufacture; Outsourcing; Sales; Supply chain management; Computational studies; Inventory coordination; Inventory management; Multi-level decisions; Supply chain network; Third party logistics; Vendor managed Inventory; Vertex enumeration; Decision making","ARC: DP140101366","Lu, J.; School of Information Technology, China; email: Jie.Lu@uts.edu.au","Elsevier Inc.",00200255,,ISIJB,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028699431

A supply chain is called decentralized when various decisions are made in different companies trying to optimize their own objectives. The proposed approach is applied to plan a wood supply chain network called Puya Wood Company. The supply chain network design problem discussed in this paper is an integrated multi-echelon, multi-product problem considering total costs of purchasing raw materials/returned product, transportation of raw materials, and inventory holding of raw materials. A coordination mechanism is designed to share information between the retailer model and the manufacturer model called centralized planning. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: (1) presenting a decentralized (distributed) approach in order to address the production and distribution problem in supply chain including manufacturer and retailers and (2) proposing a coordination mechanism in order to handle problems related to production and distribution in a two-echelon supply chain network through a decentralized approach. The proposed model is tested using real case study. Sensitivity analysis is accomplished to find the effects of changing the parameter on the results. The proposed coordination mechanism provides high-quality solutions in reasonable number of iterations for the case study.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with restaurants and chefs, farmers and/or farmers’ market vendors, and wholesale distributors. The study identified that the trust dimension of relationships is very important for restaurants and chefs and wholesale distributors with respect to local food sourcing activities. The study also found social interaction and face-to-face relations that enable deep trust (due to the knowledge transfer involved) to be vital for restaurants and chefs and wholesale distributors in the purchasing of local food from farmers and/or farmers’ market vendors, and other producers/suppliers. The major implications of the findings are that farmers need to develop trust-based relationships with their buyers in order to create better market access for local foods but that existing trust relationships can also act as a barrier to new entrants. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Food wholesalers; Local food; Purchasing; Restaurant supply; Supply chain; Trust",,,"Roy, H.; Acsenda School of Management, 1090 W Pender St, Canada; email: blueroy6@hotmail.com","Elsevier Ltd",2212571X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023633942

As a result, various criteria and uncertain situations in a complex environment encounter problems when using the traditional performance evaluation with precise and deterministic data. The purpose of this paper is to propose an applicable model for evaluating the performance of the overall supply chain (SC) network and its members. Performance evaluation methods, which do not include uncertainty, obtain inferior results. To overcome this, rough set theory (RST) was used to deal with such uncertain data and extend rough noncooperative Stackelberg data envelopment analysis (DEA) game to construct a model to evaluate the performance of supply chain under uncertainty. This applies the concept of Stackelberg game/leader-follower in order to develop models for measuring performance. The ranking method of noncooperative two-stage rough DEA model is discussed. While developing the model, which is suitable to evaluate the performance of the supply chain network and its members when it operates in uncertain situations and involves a high degree of vagueness. The application of this paper provides a valuable procedure for performance evaluation in other industries. The proposed model provides useful insights for managers on the measurement of supply chain efficiency in uncertain environment.

The purpose of this paper is to present a feasibility study for evaluating if a maritime supply chain for distribution of pellets along the Norwegian coast is economically viable. A mixed integer programming model is developed as a basis for decision support, and the model utilizes the structure of the geographical network resulting in a novel and innovative formulation of the problem. The main findings are that the operating profit margin is around 8% for the supply chain and that the model is flexible and able to design maritime distribution chains that are suitable for different levels of demand. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Maritime supply chain; Network design; Routing; Scheduling; Transportation","Decision support systems; Integer programming; Natural resources; Pelletizing; Profitability; Scheduling; Supply chains; Transportation; Geographical networks; Maritime supply chain; Mixed integer programming model; Network design; Non-renewable energy sources; Renewable energy source; Routing; Transportation network; Renewable energy resources",,"Christiansen, M.; Department of Industrial Economics and Technology Management, Alfred Getz vei 3, Norway; email: Marielle.christiansen@iot.ntnu.no","Springer New York LLC",19366582,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007452587

Their knowledge will be potential resources for new business relationship with hidden partners; however, many companies find it difficult to develop new opportunities. A recommendation of a potential partner is helpful for regional revitalization. Research into supply chains has shifted from a linear model to a network model. A network model using graph theory can topologically explain a supply chain, whereas, in a linear model, there are some differences with the real world because of a lack of information. In this study, we propose a prediction model for a new business partnership with predictors extracted from network and linear approaches used in combination for the prediction of performance and interpretability. Our dataset consisted of a network of 327,012 transactions among 131,192 companies in Northeast Japan, which was retrieved from supplier-customer relationship data provided by Teikoku Databank, Ltd. Network centralities were extracted as topological features from the network of each company. Trigram relationships were also extracted from the network motif so that the logistic flow to a company from its supplier could be used to predict customers as business partners. The results showed that the performance of the proposed model was excellent, with a high contribution of probability extracted from the trigram relationships. From this perspective, we found that the information of logistics flows is a critical factor for predicting a potential partner, even in a network model. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Forecasting; Graph theory; Public relations; Supply chains; Business partnership; Business relationships; Network centralities; Potential partners; Potential resources; Prediction of performance; Supplier-customer relationships; Topological features; Topology",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781890843366,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043478081

Most of NRL methods can widely pursue nodes classification, community detection and link prediction tasks. Due to the nodes in these kinds of networks mostly contain the common attributes and share the same neighbors, we identify them as homogeneous networks, also including real-world networks such as social network, citation network and collaborative network. Therefore, it is nature that nodes tends to connect densely with high similarity. Supply network is one of the most typical collaborative network. It is not a homogeneous network, due to the nodes present two roles-supplier and customer. As the importance of suppliercustomer relationships has become increasingly apparent that guides modern research and practice, the main impact of such researches is poured into the field of business management and operation research. However, prior studies have indicated that firms tended to manage their relationships in a more structural and relational approach, no existing literature have applied NRL into predicting business relationships. This paper proposes a novel NRL method and presents two contributions. First, we employ network analysis to extract three centralities, which can represent both local and global context. Second, we also include firm profiles as node contents to train the model by using machine learning techniques. To compare with other state-of-Theart NRL methods, our proposal assesses the concepts surrounding structural and relational characteristics and the extension of firm profiles to supply network, and also represents the infrastructure of the social science of business. © 2017 IEEE.","Link prediction; Machine learning; Network representation learning; Supply chains","Artificial intelligence; Cybernetics; Learning systems; Supply chains; Business relationships; Collaborative network; Collaborative relationships; Homogeneous network; Link prediction; Machine learning techniques; Network representation; Supplier-customer relationships; Forecasting",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538616451,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044121921

CO2 can act as an oxygen displacer, and in confined spaces humans can have, for example, reactions of dizziness, increased heart rate and blood pressure, headaches, and in more serious cases loss of consciousness. Specialized organizations can be brought in to monitor the work environment for limited periods. However, new low cost wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies offer potential for more continuous and autonomous assessment of industrial workplace air quality. Central to effective decision making is the data analytics approach and visualization of what is potentially, big data (BD) in monitoring the air quality in industrial workplaces. This paper presents a case study that monitors air quality that is collected with WSN technologies. We discuss the potential BD problems. The case trials are from two workshops that are part of a large on-shore logistics base a regional shipping industry in Norway. This small case study demonstrates a monitoring and visualization approach for facilitating BD in decision making for health and safety in the shipping industry.

The simulation results show that, compared with the traditional supply chain, the total revenue of the supply chain under the recycling mode dominated by manufacturers has improved, that the increase of the remanufacturing capacity has promoted the growth of the electronic product's sales rate, which reaches a equilibrium when remanufacturing capacity is set as 0.36, and that the recycling efficiency of e-waste has improved significantly as the e-waste recycling coefficient constantly increased. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Closed-loop supply chain; E-waste recycling management; recycling mode; remanufacturing; system dynamics",,"LBH-Z5100","Miao, S.; Computer Science and Technology Postdoctoral Programme, China; email: msdking@126.com","Taylor and Francis Ltd.",00949655,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028522174

The framework begins with a simulation of the biodiesel production system, feeding later, with suitable input parameters and suitable solutions, and a macro-location model designed to establish the regional positioning of biofuel conversion plants. Optimal regions are used as initial feasible solution space for the proposed micro-location model. In this part of the framework, we introduce an adaptation of Extended Goal Programming to rank the best municipalities (definitive locations) emphasizing the social aspects under consideration.

The technological change towards electric vehicles requires innovative activities and therefore impacts the supply industry heavily for two reasons. First, this change is a major threat, since existing powertrain parts will become obsolete. Second, alternative powertrain technologies offer opportunities for both incumbent suppliers and new market entrants. By analyzing the current supply industry structure and prospective developments arising from technological change, this study contributes to research on automotive supply networks. In order to measure and evaluate the innovative output of incumbent suppliers and of new market entrants, a patent analysis using 91,082 patents from the years 1990–2013 within four different powertrain technologies is conducted. This reveals specialization and patent portfolio quality for all firms within the automotive supply industry. The study has three key findings: (1) Innovative pressure, based on uncertainty regarding future technological development of electric vehicles, is passed on from car manufacturers to their supply networks. (2) Although most incumbent powertrain suppliers will suffer from the technological change, few Japanese suppliers intensively specialize in alternative powertrain technologies. (3) New market entrants in the supply industry will only benefit from this change if battery electric vehicles become the new dominant design, whereas this group lost its specialization in the field of fuel cell electric vehicles. Within these findings, the study explicitly reveals firms that will benefit or suffer from the technological change towards electric vehicles. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Automotive supply networks; Electric vehicles; Green supply chain management; Patent analysis; Powertrain technologies; Technological change","Automobile manufacture; Battery electric vehicles; Commerce; Electric vehicles; Fuel cells; Powertrains; Supply chain management; Automotive supply industries; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Green supply chain management; Innovative activities; Patent analysis; Supply networks; Technological change; Technological development; Patents and inventions",,"Borgstedt, P.; Center for Management, Germany; email: philipp.borgstedt@wiwi.uni-muenster.de","Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029678312

The uncertainty of the storage capacity of geological reservoirs for sequestering carbon dioxide has been noted as an important issue in the deployment and cost of a CCS infrastructure. To analyse the relationships between these strategies and the uncertainty of the storage capacity of reservoirs, we propose a novel stochastic mixed-integer linear optimisation model. It minimises investment and construction costs and the costs of capture, transport, and storage of CO2 plus the cost of emitting CO2 to the atmosphere. The model considers technical and economic aspects to resolve both CO2 pricing and the design of a supply chain network for capturing, transporting, and sequestering CO2 in geological reservoirs. We present results for a sample case from the Brazilian cement industry using a CO2 tax as currently established in other countries. We verify that, while the CO2 tax increases, it also increases the complexity of the pipeline network of the supply chain and the amount of CO2 that is captured and stored. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Capture and sequestration; Carbon emission price; Climate change; Stochastic mixed integer linear optimisation; Supply chain","Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Climate change; Costs; Geology; Global warming; Investments; Linear programming; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Uncertainty analysis; Capture and sequestration; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emission prices; Geological reservoirs; Mixed integer linear; Network infrastructure; Optimisations; Carbon capture",,,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017407862

Accordingly, designing green supply chains (SCs) that manage greenhouse gas emissions and prevent air pollution can be helpful for companies to heighten profitability and customer loyalty, besides, uncertainty of parameters and disruption strikes could adversely affect performance of SCs and lower quality of output decisions. Effective planning prevents great losses and increases reliability of manager's decisions against uncertainties. Therefore, this paper is proceeding to design a reliable bi-objective green CLSC that minimizes total costs of network aside with minimizing harmful gas emissions. The proposed model is capable of controlling adverse effects of disruptions via applying scenario-based stochastic programming approach. Also, an effective hybrid robust fuzzy stochastic programming method is extended to effectively control uncertainty of parameters and risk-aversion level of output decisions.

Nowadays, design decisions should be viable enough to function well under complex and uncertain business environments for many years or decades. Therefore, it is essential to make these decisions in the presence of uncertainty, as over the last two decades, a large number of relevant publications have emphasized its importance. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of studies in the fields of SCND and reverse logistics network design under uncertainty. The paper is organized in two main parts to investigate the basic features of these studies. In the first part, planning decisions, network structure, paradigms and aspects related to SCM are discussed. In the second part, existing optimization techniques for dealing with uncertainty such as recourse-based stochastic programming, risk-averse stochastic programming, robust optimization, and fuzzy mathematical programming are explored in terms of mathematical modeling and solution approaches.

As the result of it, the material starvation has been getting a serious problem globally. In order to circulate materials from End-of-Life (EOL) assembly products, manufactures have to design reverse supply chain networks for the EOL products. The reverse supply chain includes transportation of the EOL products from collection centers to recovery facilities and/or a disposal facility. Then, the costs are required for recycling, transportation and facilities. Additionally, the EOL product statuses differ by users situation, and average recycling rate and cost of each product and part depend on the statues. To design the reverse supply chain network, decision maker (DM) decides transportation roots, the number of products flowed on each root and production volumes at each facility in order to minimize the total cost while maximizing the average recycling rate on the whole network. However, the relationship between the recycling rate and the costs become trade-off. Therefore, the DM has to solve them simultaneously. On the other hand, Linear Physical Programming (LPP) is known as a method to solve multi-objective problems (Messac et al., 1996). It allows the DM to express his ideals as desirable ranges for each criterion. One of the most significant advantages using LPP is that the DM does not need to specify the weights for each criterion. This study designs a bi-objective reverse supply chain network to collect and recycle the EOL assembly products for the costs and the recycling rate using LPP. First, based on previous study (Ijuin et al., 2017), the reverse supply chain network is modeled to transport the EOL products from the collection centers to the recovery facilities depending on the EOL product status which includes the recycling cost and rate.

In 2012, the emissions embedded in the final-use-induced intermediate CO2 flows contributed to approximately 91.2% of the total emissions. Hence, controlling CO2 emissions along supply chains could have a significant contribution in achieving the climate mitigation goal to which the Chinese government has been committed. In this study, we first extracted final-use-induced CO2 transfer networks from input-output tables, and then applied the power-of-pull approach to the networks to identify the key sectors significantly affecting the CO2 emissions of each targeted sector's supply chains. Our results showed that each sector itself has significant power of pulling their emissions. Energy and raw material providers have played an essential role in pulling other sectors’ emissions in the past years. The results of all sectors can easily construct a network reflecting the system's characteristics. And the power-of-pull approach could easily be integrated with the structural path analysis.

A two steps analysis was carried out considering: (i) a “cradle-to-farm gate” LCA to investigate thoroughly the FS cultivation on hilly marginal land and (ii) a “cradle-to-wheels” system boundary encompassing the environmental pressure of the whole EtOH supply-use chain. Primary data related to lignocellulosic biomass production were combined with experimental feedstock conversion processes through advanced second generation technology. The purpose was the evaluation of the environmental performance of different EtOH-gasoline mixtures in midsize passenger cars: E10 (10% of EtOH and 90% of gasoline) and E85 (85% of EtOH and 15% of gasoline). N fertilization appeared as the prevailing contributor of the crop phase. The “cradle-to-wheels” results concerning E10 passenger car disclosed that the main hotspots were represented by the input of low sulphur petrol (66%) and the linked tailpipe emissions (15%), for almost all the impact categories. Otherwise, for E85 flex-fuel vehicle, the major drivers were represented by the feedstock production (46%) and the imported electricity used in the conversion facility (18%). The FS EtOH blends entailed potential environmental benefits compared with the fossil counterpart (gasoline) for climate change, ozone and fossil depletions. Otherwise, they evidenced a worse profile in terms of acidification, eutrophication and particulate matter formation. Within the context of a the prospective territorial bio-refinery network, the comparison of the annual FS bioethanol based systems with similar EtOH scenarios from giant reed perennial crops highlighted: (i) the importance to optimize the N-management for FS feedstock cultivation and (ii) the need to increase the use of the renewable energy carriers along the industrial conversion pathway. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","E10; E85; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Lignocellulosic feedstock; Second generation biofuels; Sorghum bicolor L.","Artificial life; Automobiles; Bioethanol; Cellulosic ethanol; Climate change; Crops; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Ethanol; Eutrophication; Feedstocks; Gasoline; Lignocellulosic biomass; Nitrogen fertilizers; Wheels; Environmental performance; Environmental pressures; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Lignocellulosic feedstocks; Particulate matter formations; Renewable energy carrier; Second generation; Sorghum bicolor; Life cycle; bioethanol; gasoline; nitrogen; sulfur; alcohol; biofuel; alternative energy; automobile; biofuel; environmental impact assessment; ethanol; gas production; life cycle analysis; renewable resource; sorghum; agronomic trait; Article; biofuel production; biomass; biomass conversion; car; controlled study; cropping system; electricity; environmental impact; exhaust gas; fertilization; greenhouse gas; irrigation (agriculture); Italy; life cycle assessment; soil quality; sorghum; tillage; air pollution; analysis; chemistry; climate change; energy conservation; prevention and control; sorghum; Italy; Arundo donax; Sorghum bicolor; Air Pollution; Biofuels; Climate Change; Conservation of Energy Resources; Ethanol; Gasoline; Italy; Sorghum; Vehicle Emissions",,"Zucaro, A.; Dipartimento di Biologia, Via Cintia, Italy","Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018603307

This improved user experience is achieved by Carrier Aggregation (CA), in which the available spectrum of an operator is bundled out of several frequency bands. Accordingly, the user equipment has to supply multiple reception chains and therefore consumes considerably more power during a transmission. On the other hand, transmissions terminate faster, which enables a quick switchover into energy-saving mode. In order to examine these opposed facts, empirical analyses of existing devices are first carried out. Subsequently, we present a new CA enhancement of an existing context- aware power consumption model which incorporates the development density of the environment and the mobile device mobility. Based on the extended model we perform a detailed power consumption analysis and show that CA leads to power savings of 31% if the data rate doubled for large file transmissions. In addition, we show that CA can lead to power savings even from a data rate increase of 25%, regardless of mobility and urban development density. Besides, the measurement results show that CA operated in the same band leads to a lower power consumption than inter-band CA. © 2017 IEEE.",,"4G mobile communication systems; Energy conservation; Frequency bands; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Standards; Urban growth; Wireless telecommunication systems; Carrier aggregations; Development density; Energy saving modes; Lower-power consumption; Lte mobile networks; Power consumption analysis; Power consumption model; Spectrum of an operators; Electric power utilization","DFG: A4, SFB 876",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15502252,9781509059324,IVTCD,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040536218

Yet, organisations in developing countries constitute a significant part of global supply chains and have also experienced the disastrous effects of supply chain failures. The purpose of this paper is therefore to empirically investigate SCRES in a developing country context and to show that this also provides theoretical insights into the nature of what is meant by resilience. Design/methodology/approach: Using a case study approach, a supply network of 20 manufacturing firms in Uganda is analysed based on a total of 45 interviews. Findings: The perceived threats to SCRES in this context are mainly small-scale, chronic disruptive events rather than discrete, large-scale catastrophic events typically emphasised in the literature. The data reveal how threats of disruption, resilience strategies and outcomes are inter-related in complex, coupled and non-linear ways. These interrelationships are explained by the political, cultural and territorial embeddedness of the supply network in a developing country. Further, this embeddedness contributes to the phenomenon of supply chain risk migration, whereby an attempt to mitigate one threat produces another threat and/or shifts the threat to another point in the supply network. Practical implications: Managers should be aware, for example, of potential risk migration from one threat to another when crafting strategies to build SCRES. Equally, the potential for risk migration across the supply network means managers should look at the supply chain holistically because actors along the chain are so interconnected. Originality/value: The paper goes beyond the extant literature by highlighting how SCRES is not only about responding to specific, isolated threats but about the continuous management of risk migration. It demonstrates that resilience requires both an understanding of the interconnectedness of threats, strategies and outcomes and an understanding of the embeddedness of the supply network. Finally, this study’s focus on the context of a developing country reveals that resilience should be equally concerned both with smaller in scale, chronic disruptions and with occasional, large-scale catastrophic events. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Developing Countries; Resilience; Supply Chain disruptions",,,"Stevenson, M.; Department of Management Science, United Kingdom; email: m.stevenson@lancaster.ac.uk","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",13598546,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033584653

Both horizontal and vertical relationships are being explored, which has led to recognition of the significance of the active participation of change agents in this process. This paper provides a practical example of how change agents shifted an entire chain (pig farming) towards sustainability over 17 years. The longitudinal study examined the mechanics of how change agents in a chain successfully engage others on sustainability issues. A sensemaking approach was used that focussed on three aspects: communication, action, and building relationships. The findings show that the change agents worked on different levels of supply chain collaboration in response to the evolution of the sustainability initiative. Their focus moved from producers controlling the entire chain to engaging in partnerships with other contributors both inside and outside the chain. They translated the abstract concept of sustainability into language understandable for the potential partners, fostering transparency, joined an eco-label certification program, and later invested in experiments to find solutions to new ideas as they arose through reflection. This stepwise construction of a netchain reveals the evolution of reciprocal interdependence in an informal, personal and trust-based way between organizations which can be applied to sustainability initiatives in other fields. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Change agent; Collaboration; Longitudinal; Sensemaking; Supply chain; Sustainability","Supply chains; Certification programs; Change agents; Collaboration; Longitudinal; Sensemaking; Supply chain collaboration; Sustainable supply chains; Vertical relationships; Sustainable development",,"van der Heijden, A.; Utrecht University, P.O.

To deal with uncertainty, a suitable fuzzy possibilistic approach is employed. Given robust optimization approach, the units of the supply chain are ranked based on penalties of deviations from goals as feasibility robustness and also the average and standard deviation of deviations as optimality robustness. One advantage of the proposed model is that it can determine balancing values and improvement solutions for flows among the units of a supply chain which have dual-roles factors so that the deviations from their goals are minimized.

It is not only about how to recycle, remanufacture or reuse used end products but it is also how to optimize the operations of the reverse system. A previous research has proposed a design of reverse supply chain of biodiesel network from used cooking oil. However, the research focused on the design of the supply chain strategy not the operations of the supply chain. It only decided how to design the structure of the supply chain in the next few years, and the process of each stage will be conducted in the supply chain system in general. The supply chain system has not considered operational policies to be conducted by the companies in the supply chain. Companies need a policy for each stage of the supply chain operations to be conducted so as to produce the optimal supply chain system, including how to use all the resources that have been designed in order to achieve the objectives of the supply chain system. Therefore, this paper proposes a model to optimize the operational planning of a biodiesel supply chain network from used cooking oil. A mixed integer linear programming is developed to model the operational planning of biodiesel supply chain in order to minimize the total operational cost of the supply chain. Based on the implementation of the model developed, the total operational cost of the biodiesel supply chain incurred by the system is less than the total operational cost of supply chain based on the previous research during seven days of operational planning about amount of 2,743,470.00 or 0.186%. Production costs contributed to 74.6 % of total operational cost and the cost of purchasing the used cooking oil contributed to 24.1 % of total operational cost. So, the system should pay more attention to these two aspects as changes in the value of these aspects will cause significant effects to the change in the total operational cost of the supply chain. © 2017 Author(s).",,,,"Jonrinaldi; Department of Industrial Engineering, Indonesia; email: jonrinaldi772000@gmail.com","American Institute of Physics Inc.",0094243X,9780735415904,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034420749

In this work, we propose a novel mixed-integer nonlinear fractional programming model to investigate the economic and environmental implications of incorporating modular manufacturing into well-to-wire shale gas supply chains. Both design and operational decisions regarding modular manufacturing are considered, including modular plant allocation, capacity selection, installment planning, moving scheduling, and salvage operation, as well as other decisions for shale gas supply chain design and operations, such as the drilling schedule, water management, and pipeline network construction. To systematically evaluate the full spectrum of environmental impacts, an endpoint-oriented life cycle optimization framework is applied that accounts for up to 18 midpoint impact categories and three endpoint impact categories. Total environmental impact scores are obtained to evaluate the comprehensive life cycle environmental impacts of shale gas supply chains. A tailored global optimization algorithm is also presented to efficiently solve the resulting computationally challenging problem. The applicability of proposed modeling framework is illustrated through a case study of a well-to-wire shale gas supply chain based on the Marcellus Shale. The results show that modular manufacturing succeeds in improving the economic performance of a shale gas supply chain, but it is less attractive in terms of mitigating the comprehensive environmental impacts. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","Endpoint-oriented life cycle optimization; LNG; Modular manufacturing; ReCiPe; Shale gas; Supply chain","Energy resources; Gas supply; Gases; Global optimization; Integer programming; Life cycle; Liquefied natural gas; Manufacture; Mathematical programming; Optimization; Petroleum deposits; Scheduling; Shale; Shale gas; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Water management; Environmental implications; Environmental sustainability; Global optimization algorithm; Life-cycle environmental impact; Nonlinear fractional programming; Operational decisions; Optimization framework; ReCiPe; Environmental impact","NSF: 1643244, CBET-1643244","You, F.; Robert Frederick Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, United States; email: fengqi.you@cornell.edu","American Chemical Society",21680485,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033443506

Hybrid hydrogel sorbents are outstanding, because of their high stability and selectivity. Organic-inorganic hybrid hydrogels were synthesized by thermopolymerization of acrylamide onto PEI polymer chains with N,N′-methylene bis(acrylamide) as a cross-linker. The grafted network was evidenced by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The porous structure was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The degree of cross-linking, the degree of PEI grafting, and the SiO2 concentration were studied to optimize the adsorption of REEs. The pH value of the medium greatly affected REE adsorption capacity, where the almost-neutral conditions gave the strongest bonding of REEs to active sites. Moreover, kinetic studies showed that the rate-determining step of the adsorption process was chemical sorption, and that REE diffusion within micropores was the control step for, specifically, intraparticle diffusion. The adsorbents showed excellent selectivity and recyclability for REEs through five adsorption-desorption cycles in contact with synthetic acid mine drainage solution. A high separation toward REEs over fouling metals was achieved by using a citrate-based buffer eluent solution. This hybrid hydrogel shows promise for the recycling of REEs from aqueous solutions. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","Acid mine drainage (AMD); Acrylamide; Adsorption kinetic; Hybrid hydrogel; PEI; Rare-earth elements (REEs); Recycle; Selectivity; SiO2","Adsorption; Amides; Catalyst selectivity; Chemical bonds; Crosslinking; Drainage; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Grafting (chemical); Heterojunctions; National security; Polyetherimides; Rare earth elements; Rare earths; Recycling; Scanning electron microscopy; Silica; Silicon compounds; Solutions; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Acid mine drainage; Acrylamides; Adsorption kinetics; Hybrid hydrogels; Rare earth elements (REEs); SiO2; Hydrogels","USDOE; ORISE; AECOM; NETL","Wang, Q.; U.S. Department of Energy, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, United States; email: qiuming.wang@netl.doe.gov","American Chemical Society",21680485,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033432130

We develop a multi-objective optimization model that minimizes the total cost and CO2 emissions of a regional timber logistics network and seeks for the simultaneous optimization of logistics network design and operation. The generic model is applied to a case study in Jiangle County in China. The Pareto solution set, derived by applying the normalized normal constraint method, shows the relationship between carbon emissions and total cost. Our results reveal that both network structure and the allocations of timber flows have effects on the Pareto solutions, suggesting the importance of considering network design and management together in logistics network analysis. The model results also indicate that though the current carbon price is hard to trigger the change of the timber logistics network structure in Jiangle County, it can still be a driving force to push the decision-makers to implement lower carbon logistics plans. Additionally, sensitivity analysis shows that improving road conditions can remarkably reduce CO2 emissions in the logistics network and that maintaining an appropriate ratio of timber supply to demand can lead to some compromise between carbon emissions and total cost. These findings offer new insights into the trade-offs between the carbon emissions and total cost of the regional timber logistics network, which are of value to logistics network designers and managers as well as policy-makers in the study region and beyond. © 2017 The Japanese Forest Society.","CO2 emissions; logistics network design; multi-objective optimization; supply chain management; Timber supply chain","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Managers; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chain management; Timber; CO2 emissions; Environmental issues; Logistics network; Multi-objective optimization models; Network structures; Normal constraint methods; Simultaneous optimization; Timber supply chain; Logistics; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decision making; environmental issue; logistics; multiobjective programming; network design; optimization; supply chain management; trade-off; Costs; Decision Making; E I S; Materials Handling; Optimization; Supply Chain Management; China","2014H0010, 2017J01788; FAFU: 61201405106","Qiu, R.; School of Transportation and Civil Engineering, China; email: fjnlqrz@126.com","Taylor and Francis Ltd.",13416979,,JFREF,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042547843

This data flow is necessary to support critical business decisions that may impact product cost and market share. Current SC information systems are unable to provide validated, pseudo real-time shipment tracking during the distribution phase. This information is available from a single source, often the carrier, and is shared with other stakeholders on an as-needed basis. This paper introduces an independent, crowd-validated, online shipment tracking framework that complements current enterprise-based SC management solutions. The proposed framework consists of a set of private distributed ledgers and a single blockchain public ledger. Each private ledger allows the private sharing of custody events among the trading partners in a given shipment. Privacy is necessary, for example, when trading high-end products or chemical and pharmaceutical products. The second type of ledger is a blockchain public ledger. It consists of the hash code of each private event in addition to monitoring events. The latter provide an independently validated immutable record of the pseudo real-time geolocation status of the shipment from a large number of sources using commuters-sourcing.","Blockchain; Distributed databases; Peer-to-peer networks; Supply chain","Commerce; Competition; Data transfer; Distributed computer systems; Hash functions; Real time systems; Ships; Supply chains; Block-chain; Critical business; Distributed database; High end Products; Number of sources; Pharmaceutical products; Single source; Trading partners; Peer to peer networks",,"Miled, Z.B.; Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, 723W.

The second is theoretical: evaluating whether the GPN toolkit can help explain how the nature of a commodity and its markets impact activist strategies and outcomes. Recasting industries as sites of social struggle, a GPN approach offers a more nuanced understanding of the power permeating markets than more conventional supply chain analyses. The results clarify the challenges activists face when politicising industries by targeting brands, particularly in the extractives sector. But the findings also illuminate opportunities, including the more subtle pathways of activist influence as they: (1) gather and disseminate information, (2) place social and environmental issues on the industry agenda, (3) spur industry to create institutions around these issues, (4) insert themselves and their agenda into the production network, and (5) form alliances with industry actors pushing for change. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","activism; brands; direct targeting; Global production networks; gold; jewellery","commodity; gold; goods exchange; mining; social movement; supply chain management; theoretical study","SSHRC: 752-2009-0713","Bloomfield, M.J.; Department of Social and Policy Sciences, United Kingdom; email: m.j.bloomfield@bath.ac.uk","Routledge",13563467,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019108211

Thus the users are facing increasing difficulty in selecting the correct manufacturing services from the vast amount provided or recommended by collaborative partners for service-oriented supply chain deployment. Therefore, in this paper, a novel approach is presented for recommending personalised manufacturing services by combining a Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm and the Bayesian approach. The personalised service recommendation problem is modelled to determine the optimal manufacturing services that are most probably the best selections to user preferences for some known manufacturing services. Further, the Bayesian approach decomposes such a problem of posterior probability into two sub-problems: the prior probability of a manufacturing service hypothesis before considering any user preferences, and the conditional probability of considering the aggregated preferences for some known manufacturing services as evidences when the user actually wants an unknown most preferable manufacturing service. Next, the personalised HITS algorithm is adapted to the network of service-oriented supply chain to rank the authority scores of manufacturing services that determine the relative probabilities of service execution through personalised trust propagation. The experimental results show that the proposed method can produce more accurate manufacturing service recommendation results than the existing approaches. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bayesian approach; collaborative manufacturing; HITS algorithm; manufacturing service; service discovery; service recommendation; service-oriented architecture","Bayesian networks; Genetic algorithms; Hypertext systems; Information retrieval; Information services; Manufacture; Probability; Quality of service; Supply chains; Virtual corporation; Web services; Bayesian approaches; Collaborative manufacturing; HITS algorithms; Manufacturing service; Service discovery; Service recommendations; Service oriented architecture (SOA)","NSFC: 51375429, 51475410; MOE: 15YJC870008; ZJNSF: LQ14F010006, LY17E050010","Zhang, W.Y.; School of Information, China; email: wyzhang@e.ntu.edu.sg","Taylor and Francis Ltd.",0951192X,,ICIME,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85003881195

It allows consumers to meet their basic food needs without using conventional money. It enables the added value of exchanges to remain local. It enables cooperative alternative compensation systems for producers. It reduces the dependence on external inputs in the territories. Social currencies are monetary instruments that provide networks for goods and services exchange parallel to the conventional economy in which people's needs are met using resources that are available in a territory, without requiring conventional money. Alternative short food supply chains are initiatives of grassroots innovations that reduce not only physical but relational distance between consumers and producers of any type of products. This research aims to identify the contributions of social currencies to create short food supply chains in the territories. For this, a case study is exposed: the consumption groups and community supported agriculture (CSA) of RASTRU from Asturias, northwest Spain, and its social currency Copin.

However, these interactions are largely ignored by existing distribution system design methodologies, which assume demand is constant regardless of the firm's distribution strategy. This paper describes a multidisciplinary framework that considers these interactions in the design of ""profit maximizing"" distribution networks. The framework employs two major decision support methodologies: (1) binary logit models for estimating market share considering various demand-influencing parameters such as product price and distribution service, and (2) a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model for finding optimal distribution network designs.

The Process to Planet (P2P) framework bridges this gap by combining sustainable process design with environmentally extended input output analysis. This framework extending across multiple scales provides the capability of working with process variables and designing processes at the equipment scale while considering the entire life cycle through the supply chain and economic scale models. This work expands the P2P framework to account for byproducts originating from any unit within the model. The framework is further modified to incorporate an economic objective function, henceforth developing a multiobjective (MO) optimization problem for optimal design of any generic industrial process. The modified P2P framework is demonstrated by application to a corn ethanol manufacturing process case study. The MO problem is solved using the epsilon constraint method to obtain Pareto optimal frontiers that reveal the trade-off between environmental and economic dimensions of the sustainable process design problem. Comparison between commonly practiced conventional SPD and P2P SPD Pareto curves exposes the chance of choosing non optimal solutions if the former method is employed. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","design; multiobjective optimization; multiscale modeling; sustainability","Bridges; Byproducts; Design; Ecodesign; Economic and social effects; Life cycle; Machine design; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal systems; Optimization; Pareto principle; Peer to peer networks; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Economic objective function; Epsilon-constraint method; Input output analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Manufacturing process; Multi-scale Modeling; Optimization problems; Pareto-optimal frontiers; Process design","BRDI-2012-38202-19288; NSF: CBET-1336872","Bakshi, B.R.; William G.

Leadership in short chains determines prioritization between sustainability goals. Trust and communication, more than distance, are short chain key elements. Flexible regulation can contribute to speeding up development of innovative partnerships. Qualitative research can support SMEs with an integrated vision of their supply chain. Short food supply chain (SFSCs) initiatives have developed throughout Europe as an alternative to the long industrialized chains characterizing the contemporary global food industry. They are often driven by small-scale actors belonging to different phases of the chain (producers, retailers, consumers) and rooted in specific territorial contexts. Innovative organizational models of SFSCs are attracting interest in the academic field (Jarosz, 2008, Khan and Prior, 2010, Aubry and Kebir, 2013) and beyond (RUAF, 2015). This work contributes to the debate with a focus on the logistics of SFSCs in urban and peri-urban areas across Europe, specifically on the role of local intermediaries in facilitating connections between urban consumers and peri-urban and rural farmers. The structure of three small/medium enterprises (SMEs) acting as local SFSC intermediaries has been analyzed by a research network involving researchers and entrepreneurs in a mutual learning process. The aim was to identify the main business objectives of local intermediaries in SFSCs, the elements that from the SMEs point of view characterize SFSCs and their vision of sustainability. A simple theoretical model has been developed to look at leadership of SFSCs in urban and peri-urban areas. The research process provided interesting insight into the contribution that qualitative research can give to SMEs’ reflection on their organizational model (Zakic et al., 2014). © by the American Society of Agronomy and Crop Science Society of America.",,,"FP7: 312126","Grando, S.; Universita degli Studi di Pisa, United States; email: stefanog6@yahoo.it","John Wiley and Sons Inc",25751220,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039752200

With multi-period customer demands, the model can solve a multi-plant resource allocation and production planning problem by focusing the decisions on supplier selection, facility selection, production batches, transportation mode selection, and distribution of the materials and commodities of a green supply network. In this paper, four transportation modes, namely, road, rail, air, and sea, have their corresponding transportation time, costs, and CO2 emissions. Based on multiple planning periods, this research calculates the minimal total cost and total CO2 emissions based on production and transportation capacity. Using numerical analyses, the results show that, when the budget is sufficient, only production capabilities with α = 1.5 and 2.0 are beneficial for improving environmental protection; carbon dioxide emissions of both production capacities are not significantly different. Furthermore, when the production batch size increases, total cost increases.

Implementation of testing is supported by the availability of accurate, nucleic acid based laboratory and point-of-care (POC) VL technologies and strong WHO guidance recommending routine testing to identify treatment failure. However, test implementation faces challenges related to the developing health systems in many low-resource countries. The purpose of this commentary is to review the challenges and solutions from the large-scale implementation of other diagnostic tests, namely nucleic-acid based early infant HIV diagnosis (EID) and CD4 testing, and identify key lessons to inform the scale-up of VL. Discussion: Experience with EID and CD4 testing provides many key lessons to inform VL implementation and may enable more effective and rapid scale-up. The primary lessons from earlier implementation efforts are to strengthen linkage to clinical care after testing, and to improve the efficiency of testing. Opportunities to improve linkage include data systems to support the follow-up of patients through the cascade of care and test delivery, rapid sample referral networks, and POC tests. Opportunities to increase testing efficiency include improvements to procurement and supply chain practices, well connected tiered laboratory networks with rational deployment of test capacity across different levels of health services, routine resource mapping and mobilization to ensure adequate resources for testing programs, and improved operational and quality management of testing services. If applied to VL testing programs, these approaches could help improve the impact of VL on ART failure management and patient outcomes, reduce overall costs and help ensure the sustainable access to reduced pricing for test commodities, as well as improve supportive health systems such as efficient, and more rigorous quality assurance. These lessons draw from traditional laboratory practices as well as fields such as logistics, operations management and business. Conclusions: The lessons and innovations from large-scale EID and CD4 programs described here can be adapted to inform more effective scale-up approaches for VL. They demonstrate that an integrated approach to health system strengthening focusing on key levers for test access such as data systems, supply efficiencies and network management. They also highlight the challenges with implementation and the need for more innovative approaches and effective partnerships to achieve equitable and cost-effective test access. © 2017 The Authors.

Yet most countries in sub-Saharan Africa experience significant delays in diagnosis because of operational ine ciencies in early infant diagnosis (EID) networks. We develop a two-part modeling framework relying on optimization and simulation to generate operational improvements in the assignment of clinics to laboratories and the allocation of capacity across laboratories, and to evaluate the associated impact on the number of infants initiating treatment. Applying our methodology to EID program data from Mozambique, we validate our simulation model and estimate that optimally reassigning clinics to labs would decrease the average sample turnaround time (TAT) by 11% and increase the number of infected infants starting treatment by about 4% relative to the current system. Furthermore, consolidating all diagnostic capacity in one centralized lab would decrease average TATs by an estimated 22% and increase the number of infected infants initiating treatment by 7%. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that the consolidation of capacity in a single location would remain near optimal across a wide range of laboratory utilization levels in Mozambique.

In this paper, we provide an empirical study of the topology of smartphone supply chain network. The supply chain network is constructed using open online data. Our experimental results show that the smartphone supply chain network has small-world feature with scale-free degree distribution, in which a few high degree nodes play a key role in the function and can effectively reduce the communication cost. We also detect the community structure to find the basic functional unit. It shows that information communication between nodes is crucial to improve the resource utilization.

By definition, these attributes signal asymmetric information which implies that in the presence of bounded rational individuals with conflicting interests, misconduct in the form of opportunistic behavior is bound to prevail. Increased information exchange through farmer networks is, however, expected to reduce opportunistic behavior. In the case of a differentiated meat product, such as Karoo Lamb, the article studies the farmer-abattoir transaction with the purpose of recommending strategies that can be implemented to reduce the farmer's tendency to behave opportunistically. The article employs the PLS approach to SEM and reveals a significant negative relationship between information shared and opportunistic behavior. The results indicate significant positive relationships between trust in the abattoir and information shared as well as between farmer networks and information shared. These results are indicative of the support provided to the information shared construct by higher levels of trust between farmers and abattoirs and established farmer networks. It is, therefore, recommended that differentiated meat supply chains, through their various associations, concentrate their efforts to promote information sharing by building stronger, trust centered relationships and by supporting farmer networks. © 2017 International Association of Agricultural Economists","D22; D23; D70; D82; D85; farmer networks; information sharing; Karoo Lamb; Opportunistic behavior; Q10; trust","agricultural worker; asymmetric information; farmers attitude; global trade; meat; psychology; sheep; supply chain management; Karoo; South Africa","","van der Merwe, M.; Department of Agricultural Economics, South Africa; email: melissa.vandermerwe@up.ac.za","Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01695150,,AECNB,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033706515

Home storage is the last but a neglected important tach in eggs supply chain, but few studies are available on the egg storage in the home stage. This study aimed to evaluate the internal quality change of both n-3 PUFAs enriched and conventional eggs by simulating eggs stored at consumers' home in refrigeration and under room temperature. The egg quality indices (Haugh unit, yolk index, weight, and albumen pH) were adopted and analyzed for both storage conditions. Wireless sensor network (WSN) was used for real-time monitoring of the temperature and humidity during storage. The results showed that temperature, humidity and time of storage all have an influence on the freshness of both n-3 PUFAs enriched and conventional eggs and there is no significant difference happened to n-3 PUFAs enriched eggs and conventional eggs. Refrigeration can decelerate the quality deterioration of both n-3 PUFAs enriched and conventional eggs and consumers should be educated about how to maintain the internal quality of eggs during home storage. © 2017 by the authors.","egg quality; Humidity; Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) enriched eggs; Temperature; Wireless sensor network (WSN)",,,"Liu, X.; College of Information and Electrical Engineering, China; email: liusnow@cau.edu.cn","MDPI AG",20763417,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033599227

Prior studies on supply chain structure have largely emphasized network-level attributes but ignored supply-base level characteristics. However, in many cases it is the 1st tier suppliers, not those “deep in the network,” that have most immediate influence on the buyer. In addition, some structural characteristics, such as direct links between the buyer's suppliers and its customers, are not-so-visible to the buyer, yet can impact its financial performance dramatically. The existing literature has overlooked these not-so-visible structural links. Using objective supply chain data collected from Mergent Online and Compustat, we map the supply base structure of 867 public firms. We construct three visible (horizontal, vertical and spatial) and two not-so-visible (eliminative and cooperative) structural complexity metrics, and examine their impacts on buyer firms’ financial performance as measured by Return on Assets and Tobin's Q. Our empirical analysis shows that the five dimensions have differential effects: some have negligible impacts while others appear to strongly affect financial performance. Contrary to the common belief that complexity hurts performance, we find that an individual complexity dimension may have both positive and negative effects, and the overall effect may be non-linear. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Eliminative and cooperative structural links; ROA; Supply base; Supply chain complexity; Supply chain structure; Tobin's Q","Finance; Sales; Supply chains; Structural links; Supply base; Supply chain complexity; Supply chain structures; Tobin's Q; Complex networks",,"Lu, G.; Oregon State UniversityUnited States; email: guanyi.lu@oregonstate.edu","Elsevier B.V.",02726963,,JOTME,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032569447

The widespread dissent generated in this process is aggravated by the changing composition and the worsening financial condition of its labor force—predominantly the new generation of migrant workers.

Its production is most likely hampered by the required multiple substrate supplies and complicated post-PKS modifications in Actinosynnema pretiosum subsp. pretiosum ATCC 31280. For titer improvement, gene ansa30, encoding for a glycosyltransferase competing for the N-demethyl-AP-3 (PND-3) intermediate for AP-3 biosynthesis, was initially inactivated. In the mutant NXJ-22, the AP-3 titer was increased by 66% along with an obvious accumulation of PND-3, indicating that the N-methylation is a rate-limiting step. Alternatively, when abundant upstream intermediate 19-chloroproansamitocin was fed into a PKS mutant, 3-O-acylation was further identified along with the N-methylation as the rate-limiting steps. Subsequent overexpression of N-methyltransferase gene asm10 in NXJ-22 resulted in a 93% increase of AP-3 and a corresponding 92% decrease of PND-3. Additional supplementation of L-methionine, the precursor for SAM biosynthesis, substantially decreased the accumulation of PND-3. In parallel, the 3-O-acylation bottleneck was relieved by feeding with L-valine to NXJ-22, resulting in a 126% increase of AP-3. Eventually, a combined asm10 overexpression and supplementation of L-methionine and L-valine resulted in a 5-fold increase of AP-3, from 42 ± 2 mg L−1 to 246 ± 6 mg L−1, without any noticeable accumulation of PND-3. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Since most of the data is currently stored in cloud data centers, it also compares how blockchain performs vis-vis the cloud in various aspects of security and privacy. Key underlying mechanisms related to the blockchain's impacts on the Internet of Things (IoT) security are also covered. From the security and privacy considerations, it highlights how blockchain-based solutions could possibly be, in many aspects, superior to the current IoT ecosystem, which mainly relies on centralized cloud servers through service providers. Using practical applications and real-world examples, the paper argues that blockchain's decentralized feature is likely to result in a low susceptibility to manipulation and forgery by malicious participants. Special consideration is also given to how blockchain-based identity and access management systems can address some of the key challenges associated with IoT security. The paper provides a detailed analysis and description of blockchain's roles in tracking the sources of insecurity in supply chains related to IoT devices. The paper also delves into how blockchain can make it possible to contain an IoT security breach in a targeted way after it is discovered. It discusses and evaluates initiatives of organizations, inter-organizational networks and industries on this front. A number of policy implications are discussed. First, in order to strengthen IoT, regulators can make it obligatory for firms to deploy blockchain in supply chain, especially in systems that are mission critical, and have substantial national security and economic benefits. Second, public policy efforts directed at protecting privacy using blockchain should focus on providing training to key stakeholders and increasing investment in this technology. Third, one way to enrich the blockchain ecosystem would be to turn attention to public–private partnerships. Finally, national governments should provide legal clarity and more information for parties to engage in smart contracts that are enforceable. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain; Cloud computing; Cybersecurity; Internet of things; Privacy; Supply chain","Cloud computing; Data privacy; Ecology; Economics; Ecosystems; National security; Public policy; Supply chains; Block-chain; Cyber security; Identity and access managements; Inter-organizational network; Internet of thing (IOT); Malicious participant; Public private partnerships; Security and privacy; Internet of things",,,"Elsevier Ltd",03085961,,TEPOD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029692903

Global supply chain networks in Asia should reduce not only CO2 emissions but also the fixed opening costs for factories/routes as well as the cost of transportation and procurement. Life cycle assessment (LCA) quantitatively estimates and visualizes the CO2 emissions for each part based on their component materials produced on a country by country basis using a life cycle inventory (LCI) database. In general, in order to reduce both of the CO2 emissions and the costs, supply chain planners should make the decision to switch the suppliers of component parts with higher CO2 emissions but lower procurement costs from emerging countries and/or with lower CO2 emissions but higher procurement costs from developed countries. In addition, the European Union (EU) approaches to reducing CO2 emissions through the introduction of emissions tax and trading. This study proposes a design method of an Asian global supply chain network that minimizes the costs under targeted material-based CO2 emissions reduction ratios, and determines the suppliers and factory locations that satisfy demands for low-carbon material supply, through the adoption of the Asian LCI database. Based on this result, a sensitivity analysis is conducted by changing emission prices for reducing the costs and the carbon emissions, and the difference between the supply chain networks comprising of either two and three different Asian countries is compared. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Asian life cycle inventory (LCI) database; Bill of materials (BOM); Emissions trading; Low-carbon supplier selection; Sustainable and green manufacturing","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cost reduction; Costs; Database systems; Design; Ecodesign; Emission control; Global warming; International law; Life cycle; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Bill of materials; Emissions Trading; Green manufacturing; Life cycle inventory database (LCI); Supplier selection; Cost benefit analysis","JSPS: 26282082","Yamada, T.; Department of Infomatics, 1-5-1 Chofugaoka, Japan; email: tyamada@uec.ac.jp","Elsevier Ltd",03608352,,CINDD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029610503

The aim of this study was to use a value chain framework to characterize the broiler chicken meat system of Nairobi, its governance and sanitary risks. A total of 4 focus groups and 8 key informant interviews were used to collect cross-sectional data from: small-scale broiler farmers in selected Nairobi peri-urban and informal settlement areas; medium to large integrated broiler production companies; traders and meat inspectors in live chicken and chicken meat markets in Nairobi. Qualitative data were collected on types of people operating in the system, their interactions, sanitary measures in place, sourcing and selling of broiler chickens and products. Framework analysis was used to identify governance themes and risky sanitary practices present in the system. One large company was identified to supply 60% of Nairobi's day-old chicks to farmers, mainly through agrovet shops. Broiler meat products from integrated companies were sold in high-end retailers whereas their low value products were channelled through independent traders to consumers in informal settlements. Peri-urban small-scale farmers reported to slaughter the broilers on the farm and to sell carcasses to retailers (hotels and butcheries mainly) through brokers (80%), while farmers in the informal settlement reported to sell their broilers live to retailers (butcheries, hotels and hawkers mainly) directly. Broiler heads and legs were sold in informal settlements via roadside vendors. Sanitary risks identified were related to lack of biosecurity, cold chain and access to water, poor hygiene practices, lack of inspection at farm slaughter and limited health inspection in markets. Large companies dominated the governance of the broiler system through the control of day-old chick production. Overall government control was described as relatively weak leading to minimal official regulatory enforcement. Large companies and brokers were identified as dominant groups in market information dissemination and price setting. Lack of farmer association was found to be system-wide and to limit market access. Other system barriers included lack of space and expertise, leading to poor infrastructure and limited ability to implement effective hygienic measures. This study highlights significant structural differences between different broiler chains and inequalities in product quality and market access across the system. It provides a foundation for food safety assessments, disease control programmes and informs policy-making for the inclusive growth of this fast-evolving sector. © 2017 The Authors","Chicken; Disease risks; Food system; Governance; Nairobi; Value chain","agricultural worker; animal health; Article; broiler; carcass; chick; chicken; chicken meat; environmental sanitation; food safety; food storage; genetic selection; head; information processing; interview; Kenya; leg; market; nonhuman; sanitation; slaughterhouse; analysis; animal; animal husbandry; commercial phenomena; cross-sectional study; human; legislation and jurisprudence; meat; risk; statistics and numerical data; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Chickens; Commerce; Cross-Sectional Studies; Farmers; Humans; Kenya; Meat; Risk; Sanitation","G1100783/1; MRC: G1100783; BBSRC; ESRC; NERC","Carron, M.; Royal Veterinary College (RVC), Hawkshead Lane, United Kingdom; email: mcarron@rvc.ac.uk","Elsevier B.V.",01675877,,PVMEE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029496590

The test is conducted by comparing the observed IC output with the expected test responses for a set of test patterns; the test patterns are generated using automatic test pattern generation algorithms. Existing test-pattern generation algorithms aim to achieve higher fault coverage at lower test costs. In an attempt to reduce the size of test data, these algorithms reveal the maximum information about the internal circuit structure. This is realized through sensitizing the internal nets to the outputs as much as possible, unintentionally leaking the secrets embedded in the circuit as well. In this paper, we present HackTest, an attack that extracts secret information generated in the test data, even if the test data do not explicitly contain the secret. HackTest can break the existing intellectual property protection techniques, such as camouflaging, within 2 min for our benchmarks using only the camouflaged layout and the test data. HackTest applies to all existing camouflaged gate-selection techniques and is successful even in the presence of the state-of-The-Art test infrastructure, i.e., test data compression circuits. Our attack necessitates that the IC test data generation algorithms can be reinforced with security. &copy; 2005-2012 IEEE.","hardware security; IC camouflaging; IP piracy; reverse engineering; VLSI testing","Hardware security; Integrated circuits; Network security; Reverse engineering; Supply chains; Timing circuits; Integrated circuits (ICs); Intellectual property protection techniques; Ip piracies; Selection techniques; Test Data Compression; Test infrastructures; Test pattern generations; VLSI testing; Automatic test pattern generation","NSF; CNS: 1652842; ARO: 65513-CS; CUNY","Yasin, M.; New York UniversityUnited States; email: yasin@nyu.edu","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15566013,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029423877

We argue that the success of these cases relies on the capability of the VBFC in question to combine both normative values and economic concerns equally, by allowing the two to become hybridised. The hybridisation, we argue, helps to secure the reproduction of the central normative values without reducing them to an ‘added value’ to pass from one actor to another. Theoretically, we build our approach on social systems theory together with the theory of essentially contested concepts.

The production lots of each vendor are transferred to the buyer in batches increasing in size according to a fixed factor, where the size of the batches may differ from vendor to vendor. To coordinate the production cycles of the vendors and the consumption cycle of the buyer, we use two different shipment policies, namely one policy where batches are shipped to the buyer directly after their completion, and one policy where shipments are made whenever the inventory at the buyer reaches zero. Mathematical models are proposed for each policy, and solution procedures are suggested. Subsequently, the performance of the policies is evaluated in a numerical experiment, and both policies are compared to the situation where batches of equal sizes are shipped from the vendors to the buyer.

However, to enhance the financial and ecological impact of the network, the forward and reverse supply chain networks must integrate well so that decisions taken in both areas complement each other. In this study, we propose an eco-efficient CLSC design for extending the existing supply chain of an Indian firm that assembles inkjet printers. The network design is configured as a multi-objective model in a multi-period setting and is mathematically formulated into a mixed integer programming problem with fuzzy objectives. Fuzziness provides flexibility to the decision makers because they must accommodate the conflicting nature of the objectives. The fuzzy multi-objective model incorporates the firm's economic and environmental concerns into the decision making process by selecting environmentally responsible suppliers to procure components based on sustainable criteria, choosing appropriate recovery options for end-of-use (EOU) inkjet printers, and planning an efficient transportation network design for reducing the carbon emission of the distribution and collection activities. The uniqueness of the proposed fuzzy CLSC optimization model lies in providing an integrated decision making framework that can aid the manufacturer in making crucial strategic, tactical, and operational decisions of optimal selection of suppliers, component order allocation, recovery flow allocation, and vehicle routing planning. The novelty of the model also lies in simultaneously minimising the overall cost of the activities undertaken, maximizing the performance of the component suppliers and minimising the carbon emissions of the associated transportation activities. A weighted fuzzy mathematical programming approach is utilised for generating a fuzzy, properly efficient solution as the desired compromised solution for the CLSC network problem configuration. The relevance of the model is justified using a real data set derived from a case study of the firm based in the northern capital region (NCR) of India. The findings indicate that the proposed integrated CLSC network model enables the firm in gaining sustainably from the numerous electronic product reuse opportunities in the Indian market. Further, while costly to begin with, choosing suppliers with higher sustainable performance and vehicles with lesser emission rate could substantially enhance firm's sustainable image and result in higher profits in the future. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","AHP; Carbon emission; Factor analysis; Fuzzy multi-objective programming; k-means clustering; Supplier selection","Automobile manufacture; Decision making; Environmental impact; Factor analysis; Ink jet printers; Integer programming; Mathematical programming; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Printing machinery; Printing presses; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Vehicle routing; Carbon emissions; Closed-loop supply chain networks; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); Fuzzy mathematical programming; K-means clustering; Multiobjective programming; Properly efficient solutions; Supplier selection; Computer system recovery",,"Govindan, K.; Centre for Sustainable Supply Chain Engineering, Denmark; email: kgov@iti.sdu.dk","Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028059919

This change in the blood supply chain landscape, accompanied by an increasing emphasis on cost efficiency, is a driver of Mergers & Acquisitions between blood banks. In this paper, we first present supply chain network optimization pre- and post-merger models. The models handle perishability of the life-saving product of blood, include both operational and discarding costs of waste, capture the uncertainty associated with the demand points, as well as the expected total blood supply shortage cost and the total discarding cost at demand points. They also incorporate capacities on the links. Their solution yields the optimal path and link flows plus the frequencies of activities associated with blood collection, shipment, testing and processing, storage, and distribution, and incurred total costs.

The paper introduces Bayesian hazard rate models to account for uncertainties of the explanatory covariates, in particular, information collected during product development, major design change/upgrade efforts, and manufacturing technology upgrades. In doing so, it improves both the accuracy of extant hazard rate models for reliability problem detection as well as the lead-time for detection.

Although several solution methods have been developed to solve this problem, mainly based on heuristic techniques, they have serious limitations in the number of warehouses, products, and consumer zones they can handle. This issue restrains their practical applications to the specific addressed real-world problem, involving hundreds of elements in these dimensions. The heuristic approach, combining a multi-start mechanism and a rounding strategy, is specially developed to solve large-scale problems in reasonable time. The rounding strategy solves the models proposed by the multi-start mechanism. This integration allows the required diversification in the solution search, avoiding stagnation in a local optimum. The heuristic method is first evaluated using randomly generated instances, with different sizes in terms of the number of suppliers, factories, warehouses, products, and customer zones. The obtained results show the solution method is competitive, compared with previous developed approaches, with the advantage of solving larger instances efficiently and effectively. The heuristic is then applied to the company, aiming to restructure its supply chain due to the overture of a new factory.

We conduct a Delphi study with 29 supply chain experts to collect qualitative and quantitative data, and identify a total of 22 factors that are grouped into six categories: information utilization, technology utilization, power structures, culture, business process, and legal. All 22 factors pose challenges to information sharing beyond the dyadic relationships, and certain factors such as trust are regarded as barriers, i.e. too difficult to resolve for implementing multi-tier information sharing. With respect to the many antecedents that are identified, the study highlights several difficulties for companies to achieve seamless information flows across multi-tier supply chains. These difficulties concern relational, behavioral, and structural issues in networks of multiple companies. For instance, there is a lack of an overarching purpose and process so that all partners work toward the same goal, and an increased number of relationships make it difficult to build strong relationships and to formalize contracts. The multiple links and exchanges also make it difficult to forecast, aggregate, and share accurate and timely information in a secure manner. This research study is one of the few that empirically explores information sharing across multi-tier supply chains and, as such, provides new insights to why the challenges may be difficult to resolve in a multi-tier setting. © 2017 The Authors","Antecedent; Challenges; Delphi study; Information sharing; Multi-tier; Supply chain","Information analysis; Supply chains; Antecedent; Challenges; DELPHI study; Information sharing; Multi-tier; Information dissemination",,"Kembro, J.; Lund University, Sweden; email: joakim.kembro@tlog.lth.se","Elsevier B.V.",09255273,,IJPCE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021934879

Network-DEA models using radial measures of efficiency have been used to address supply chain performance evaluation problems. However, such models applied to bank supply chains are found to have potentially three disadvantages. First, they do not consider bank supply chains’ undesirable outputs. Second, existing studies frequently omit the impact of the heterogeneity of production technologies across different bank supply chain systems. Third, Network-DEA models fail to deconstruct the latent improvement sources of performance, thus unable to support adequately decision makers’ policy targets. To address these issues, this paper proposes two alternative network-DEA models which incorporate the directional distance function (DDF) and meta-frontier methods for evaluating bank supply chain system performance. The main characteristic of the proposed models is that they take intrinsic technology-level differences between different supply chains into account. To measure the technology levels of different types of bank supply chain systems, this paper proposes a technology gap ratio (TGR) index. A case study of 16 Chinese commercial banks from 2007 to 2014 is presented to exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed network-DEA models and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed TGR index to the supply chain performance evaluation problem in the bank industry. Empirical results show that the deposit/loan efficiency of Chinese banks is still relatively low. The managerial and technological factors cause Chinese banks’ deposit/loan inefficiency. Specific suggestions are also proposed for each type of banks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Directional distance function (DDF); Meta-frontier; Performance evaluation; Supply chain; Technology gap","Chains; Complex networks; Efficiency; Function evaluation; Inventory control; Directional distance function; Meta-frontier; Performance evaluation; Production technology; Supply chain performance; Supply chain systems; Technological factors; Technology gap; Supply chains","NSFC: 71501139, 71571173, 71602182; BK20150307; 2015SJB525","Ji, X.; School of Business, China; email: xxj150630@utdallas.edu","Elsevier Ltd",03608352,,CINDD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021137949

The first contribution is in considering the multisource Weber problem (MWP) in the presence of both source points and demand points rather than either alone. The second contribution is that the selection of intermediate facilities for further discrete analysis is based on a quantitative determination rather than a subjective selection process, which is typical of most popular commercial-grade mathematical programming (LP and IP) based location models. While the mathematical programming approach benefits from a degree of richness in features and a sense of computational optimization, one limitation is that the candidate locations to be evaluated must be specified, often without any computational basis for them. Computational experiments on randomly generated problem instances and real case studies indicate that significant gains can be achieved with relatively little effort by expanding the boundary of analysis to include multiple suppliers and multiple customers in the analysis and design of a supply chain network. An alternating location-allocation-type heuristic method is developed that is easy to implement.

Each job includes a time window delimited by its ready and due dates. For a manufacturer, the ready date of a job refers to the delivery date for the job's raw materials promised by its upstream supplier, whereas the due date of the job is the date the manufacturer promised to deliver to its downstream customer. Ready and due dates are the parameters of the scheduling problem of the manufacturer and the processing times in which all orders are expected to lie within their time window. Finding a feasible schedule is sufficient for most manufacturers who disregard the objective functions commonly seen in existing literatures. If such a feasible schedule is not possible, suggestions for re-negotiation with the supplier and/or buyer are calculated using the proposed method which minimizes earliness and tardiness costs. To the best of our knowledge, no prior research has thoroughly addressed this scheduling problem. Three methods based on the mixed integer programming (MIP), namely, the hard-constraint mixed integer programming (HCMIP), the earliness-tardiness mixed integer programming (ETMIP), and the three-phase heuristics-initialized mixed integer programming (HIMIP), are proposed and tested.

RFID technology can be used in a closed-loop supply chain to improve the efficiency of ordering and the operation of a just-in-time remanufacturing system; however, this invariably incurs costs. Companies must carefully consider the opportunities and challenges posed by RFID technology to ensure that such an investment is worthwhile. This study contributes to the body of existing closed loop supply chain literature through formulating the problems as continuous functions to reduce the complexity of the problems and decrease the amount of data required which greatly facilitates development and implementation. The objective of this study was to determine the number of distribution centers, the number of remanufacturing centers, the joint replenishment cycle time, and the investment in RFID required to minimize total network costs.

At least one-third of adult carriers of a FMR1 premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) are at risk of presenting an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). In an attempt to provide new insights into the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of FXTAS, we characterized mitochondrial function and dynamics by the assessment of oxidative respiratory chain function, mitochondrial content, oxidative stress levels, and mitochondrial network complexity. Regarding mitochondrial function, we found that mitochondrial respiratory capacity is compromised in skin fibroblasts whereas in blood, no differences were observed between the FXTAS and control groups. Furthermore, fibroblasts from FXTAS patients presented altered mitochondrial architecture, with more circular and less interconnected mitochondria being observed. Mitochondrial function and dynamics deregulation and characteristic of neurological disorders are present in FXTAS patients. These features might be limiting temporal and spatial bioenergetics cells supply and thus contributing to disease pathogenesis. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","FXTAS; Mitochondrial dynamics; Mitochondrial dysfunction; Oxygen uptake; ROS production","reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); adult; aged; Article; clinical article; controlled study; degenerative disease; female; fragile X associated tremor ataxia syndrome; human; human cell; male; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrial respiration; oxidative phosphorylation; oxidative stress; oxygen consumption; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; skin fibroblast; ataxia; fibroblast; fragile X syndrome; metabolism; mitochondrion; mononuclear cell; pathology; physiology; tremor; Ataxia; Female; Fibroblasts; Fragile X Syndrome; Humans; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Male; Mitochondria; Tremor","2014 SGR603; AGAUR; ISCIII: PI12/00879; ERDF; IDIBAPS","Milà, M.; Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics Department, C/Villarroel 170, Spain; email: mmila@clinic.ub.es","Humana Press Inc.",08937648,,MONBE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992128149

We collected data from four case-study Original Equipment Manufacturers and six associated suppliers and analysed these using Template Analysis and cross-case analysis. Our findings reveal how the power of the system, operationalized through relative performance measures, performance measurement mechanisms and the individuals in-charge of them, provides a facilitative context within which other dimensions of power operate. Here, the power of resources (expert and legitimate power), processes (associated with raising issues, cross-functional teams, early supplier involvement and reviews) and meaning (creating legitimacy through reviews) interact to support knowledge integration within innovation projects in supply chains. This, we argue, emphasises the plurality of power dimensions deployed and importance of their interrelationships in facilitating knowledge integration within hierarchical supply chain networks. © 2016 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,,,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",00336807,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990941252

The main objective is to minimize the sum of transportation costs and fixed costs of stations in assemblers. Solving this problem poses several methodological challenges. To this end, the paper developed a powerful evolutionary algorithm (EA) which was successfully applied to a large pool of benchmark instances. The EA solved instances with up to 140 manufacturers and customers, and with up to 130 assemblers. Computational analyses are performed to empirically calculate the effect of various problem parameters, such as total cost, transportation cost and number of stations. The EA is validated on benchmark instances where it provides competitive solutions.

As a dynamic and temporary form of alliance from the resource perspective, virtual enterprises (VEs) may contribute network resource heterogeneity and sustain competitive advantage. In addition, agility is suggested as a rare, valuable, network resource that is difficult to imitate and that cannot easily be substituted by other attributes. Although many researchers have investigated VEs and their agility, the research pays less attention to the relationship between VEs and agility in complex SC situations. This paper therefore investigates the relationship between VE and agility in SCs (ASCs) and explores drivers and enablers of agility and outcomes. To clarify the relationships between factors a structural equation model (SEM) is adopted to examine the model fit according to the measurement variables and supporting hypotheses. The results provide rich empirical evidence of the beneficial impact of VEs on ASCs, and theoretical and managerial insights that can be used to strengthen the drivers, enablers and capabilities to enhance the effectiveness of VE collaboration in ASCs in a global and dynamic context. Also, the analysis results can aid a decision maker which ones of the factors are the important ones that he or she should devote more resources and efforts on. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agility in supply chains; Higher-order factor analysis; Resource-based view; Structural equation model; Virtual enterprises","Decision making; Factor analysis; Supply chains; Virtual corporation; Advanced informations; Competitive advantage; Dynamic contexts; Higher-order; Resource-based view; Sharing resources; Structural equation modeling; Virtual enterprise; Competition",,"Cang, S.; Faculty of Management, United Kingdom; email: scang@bournemouth.ac.uk","Elsevier Ltd",09574174,,ESAPE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018936464

The aim of this study was to identify the different livestock systems in Nairobi, their supply chains, and their management and food safety risks. Seven focus group discussions with livestock production officers in charge of each major Nairobi sub-county were conducted. Data were collected on the type of systems existing for each livestock species and their supply chains, disease management, food safety risks, and general husbandry and gender factors. Supply chain flow diagrams and thematic analysis of the data was done. Results of the study show a large variability of livestock keeping in Nairobi. The majority were small scale with: < 5 dairy cows, 1-6 dairy goats, < 10 small ruminants, < 20 pigs, 200-500 broilers, 300-500 layers, < 10 indigenous chickens, or < 20 rabbits. Beef keeping was mainly described as a ""by the way"" system or done by traders to fatten animals for 3 month. Supply chain analysis indicated that most dairy farmers sold milk directly to consumers due to ""lack of trust"" of these in traders. Broiler and pig farmers sold mainly to traders but are dependent on few large dominating companies for their replacement or distribution of products. Selling directly to retailers or consumers (including own consumption), with backyard slaughtering, were important chains for small-scale pig, sheep and goat, and indigenous chicken keepers. Important disease risk practices identified were associated with consumption of dead and sick animals, with underground network of brokers operating for ruminant products. Qualified trained health managers were used mainly by dairy farmers, and large commercial poultry and pig farmers, while use of unqualified health managers or no treatment were common in small-scale farming. Control of urban livestock keepers was reported difficult due to their ""feeling of being outlaws,"" ""lack of trust"" in government, ""inaccessibility"" in informal settlements, ""lack of government funding,"" or ""understaffing.""

A case study was applied to examine the applicability of the developed model and the performance of the proposed solution approaches. Results are offered and discussed in order to determine a trade-off solution among the considered criteria for solving the meat supply chain network design problem. The developed tri-criteria optimization model can be used as an aided tool by decision makers for designing and optimizing food supply chain networks. © 2017 Chinese Automation and Computing Society in the UK - CACSUK.","Multi-criteria; Product quality; Solution approach; Supply chain","Automation; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Food supply; Meats; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Quality control; Supply chains; Cost effective design; Decision-making algorithms; Facility location allocations; Multi-criteria; Multicriteria optimization; Optimization modeling; Solution approach; Supply chain network design; Product design",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9780701702618,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040021135

It is basically a food grain supply chain to serve the needy population of the country. PDS currently suffers from problems like ghost beneficiaries, leakage, wastage of resources, non-accountability, non-transparency, etc. One of the major problems present in this system is the existence of duplicate and bogus ration cards. The Unique Identification Authority of India uniquely identifies each individual in the country. This mechanism could help us in the elimination of the problem of duplicate and bogus ration cards. In this paper, there exists an empirical study on the unique identification mechanism to identify the beneficiaries in PDS and Agent-Based social simulation of PDS. Public Distribution System is a non-profit system and the subject considered here is a supply chain that is distributed across all the states of India. The social phenomena of food grain supply chain i.e. Public Distribution System is simulated based on the principles of a multi agent based system.

Logistics and sustainment are traditionally brought into the IoT conversation through asset tracking, transportation, and Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS). However the IoT has additional aspects that can be related to logistics information systems and automated test. In relation to Automated Test Systems, the IoT can be a valuable component while an ATS may also use IoT concepts and capabilities within its own architecture. ATSs are applicable in all layers of the IoT: sensing, networking / communications, and applications. An ATS can be a sensor in the IoT serving to inform sustaining engineering, product support management, maintenance planning, and supply chain decisions through its test and diagnostic data. In addition, many ATSs consist of a network of instrumentation and measurement devices that can serve as part of the IoT network / communication layer. And finally an automated test and diagnostic application can be used in the IoT to expand the scale of testing beyond standard automated test capability. This paper describes and analyzes the implementation of Automated Test Systems in all three IoT layers. The described ATS / IoT interactions elicit multiple benefits and challenges. The ubiquity and diversity of sensors in the Internet of Things allows for a new scope of testing across an enterprise, correlation of asset usage and repair, supply chain prognostics, and opportunities for deep learning. Challenges inevitably include cybersecurity and the analysis of overwhelming data. The paper also outlines how these concepts extend to related topics such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Everything (IoE). In many ways Automated Test Systems presage the Internet of Things and certainly earn a high degree of thingosity. © 2017 IEEE.","ATS; Automated Test System; Internet of Things; IoT; LIS; Logistics Information System","Automatic testing; Automation; Embedded systems; Information systems; Network layers; Structural health monitoring; Supply chains; Test facilities; Automated test systems; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Diagnostic applications; Health and usage monitoring systems; Instrumentation and measurements; Internet of thing (IOT); Logistics information systems; Sustaining engineerings; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049226,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038593933

While these changes enhance sustainability and efficiency, they also create significant management challenges as the complexity of power systems increases. To tackle these challenges, decentralized Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions are emerging, which arrange local communities into transactive microgrids. Within a transactive microgrid, ""prosumers"" (i.e., consumers with energy generation and storage capabilities) can trade energy with each other, thereby smoothing the load on the main grid using local supply. It is hard, however, to provide security, safety, and privacy in a decentralized and transactive energy system. On the one hand, prosumers' personal information must be protected from their trade partners and the system operator. On the other hand, the system must be protected from careless or malicious trading, which could destabilize the entire grid. This paper describes Privacypreserving Energy Transactions (PETra), which is a secure and safe solution for transactive microgrids that enables consumers to trade energy without sacrificing their privacy. PETra builds on distributed ledgers, such as blockchains, and provides anonymity for communication, bidding, and trading. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

It connects objects such as smart phones, sensors, Light Emitting Diodes (LED) displays, vehicles through the internet allowing them to interact and exchange information among themselves. In today's times IoT has found its application in practically every walk of life and supply chain management is no exception. At present, supply chains are becoming increasingly complex, where suppliers and customers stretch between various countries and continents. The biggest problem faced by manufacturers is to optimize supply chain performance and reduce operational costs over such large geographical stretches. IoT acts as a solution to this problem as it facilitates the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in order to interconnect all the various actors in a supply chain. This humongous network of interconnected devices generate massive amounts of data which is difficult to store and process.

To achieve this, a decision-making framework is proposed in this work, to holistically optimize the design and planning of the glycerol-based biorefinery supply chains under uncertainties. This framework presents a multilayered strategy composed of different steps, and it is strongly based on optimization techniques, detailed economic and environmental assessment, and multiobjective optimization under a stochastic environment. To maximize the business value, the economic objective is measured by the Net Present Value (NPV), whereas the environmental performance is measured by the estimation of a Single Indicator (SI) through the application of LCA methods. As part of the framework, a stochastic multiperiod, multiproduct, and multiechelon mixed integer linear programming problem is proposed based upon a previous model, GlyThink. In the new formulation, market uncertainties are taken into account at the strategic planning level. The robustness of the supply chain structures is analyzed based on statistical data provided by the implementation of the Monte Carlo method, where a deterministic optimization problem is solved for each scenario. Furthermore, the solution of the stochastic multiobjective optimization model points to the Pareto set of trade-off solutions obtained when maximizing the NPV and minimizing environmental consequences. Therefore, the proposed framework ultimately leads to the identification of the optimal design and planning decisions for the development of environmentally conscious biorefinery supply chains.

However, this goal is currently not reachable due to lack of investments in biogas plants. In this paper, a mixed integer programming (MIP) model for finding the optimal production and investment plan for a biogas supply chain is presented to ensure better economy for the full chain hopefully stimulating future investments in biogas. The model makes use of step-wise linear functions to represent capital and operational expenditures at the biogas plant; considers the chain from the farmer to the end market; and includes changes of mass and energy content along the chain by modeling the losses and gains for all processes in the chain. Biomass inputs are scheduled on a weekly basis whereas energy outputs are scheduled on an hourly basis to better capture the changes of energy prices and potentially take advantage of these changes. The model is tested on a case study with co-digestion of straw, sugar beet and manure, considering natural gas, heat, and electricity as end products. The model finds a production and investment plan for a predefined location of the plant within half an hour of central processing unit (CPU) time. The resulting project turns out to be profitable and gives a production plan for each process, which underlines the possibilities of optimizing the processes in a biogas project. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass and bioenergy supply chains; Network flow optimization; OR in energy; Supply chain optimization","Biogas; Biomass; Economics; Energy dissipation; Energy policy; Fertilizers; Integer programming; Production control; Program processors; Sugar beets; Supply chains; Bioenergy supplies; Mixed integer programming model; Network flow optimizations; Operational expenditures; Optimal production; OR in energy; Renewable energies; Supply chain optimization; Investments",,"Jensen, I.G.; Technical University of Denmark, Produktionstorvet, Building 426, DK-2800 Kongens Lyngby, Denmark; email: idje@dtu.dk","Elsevier B.V.",03772217,,EJORD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017416038

When durations or temperatures increase, product quality decreases and more effort is required to deliver products in time and with the right quality. Different network designs lead to different durations and conditions of transport, storage, processing, etc. Therefore, when making network design decisions, consequences for lead time and product quality should be taken into account. As decay of perishable products, for instance food, is often not uniform, heterogeneity in product quality decay also has to be considered. The aim of this paper is to show how product quality decay as well as its heterogeneity can be integrated in a network design model. A new mixed integer linear programming formulation is presented, which positions stocks and allocates processes to maximise profit under quality constraints. It is applied to several test instances from the horticultural sector. Results show that different levels of decay lead to different network structures. Changing decay rates due to processing particularly affect the level of postponement. Heterogeneity in product quality causes a split in product flows with high and low product quality. All in all, it is shown that heterogeneous product quality decay should be taken into account in network design as it significantly influences network designs and their profitability, especially when the supply chain includes processes that change the level of decay, and product quality differences can be exploited in serving different markets. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Customer order decoupling point; Distribution; Location; OR in agriculture; Postponement","Agricultural products; Agriculture; Decay (organic); Integer programming; Location; Logistics; Profitability; Quality control; Supply chains; Transportation; Customer order decoupling point; Distribution; Environmental conditions; Fresh agricultural products; Heterogeneous products; Mixed integer linear programming; OR in agriculture; Postponement; Product design",,"de Keizer, M.; Operations Research and Logistics Group, Hollandseweg 1, 6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; email: marlies.dekeizer@wur.nl","Elsevier B.V.",03772217,,EJORD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017185051

The main idea behind the energy recovery circuits is the use of a slowly rising and slowly falling AC power supply i.e., sinusoidal or trapezoidal clock signal. Hence, it is essential to design low power clocking schemes for such energy recovery circuits. This paper presents an efficient clocking scheme for the energy recovery circuits. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The single phase sinusoidal clock signal which is used to operate the energy recovery circuits is generated from the 2N2P resonant clock generator. The sinusoidal clock signal is routed to the energy recovery circuits through the H-tree clock distribution network. Findings: Single phase energy recovery circuit, namely, the Glitch free and Cascadable Adiabatic Logic (GFCAL) is used to validate the clock network design. 16 inverters are cascaded and connected to the output nodes of the clock tree, and the cascaded chain is driven by the clock signal. Conclusion/Improvement: The simulation results show that the 16-bit adiabatic inverter chain operated at 2GHz incur a power consumption of 184.1 μWatts and the conventional CMOS inverter chain of 16-bit operated at the same frequency incurs power dissipation of 190.2μWatts.

This article examines how organisations produced, acquired, and shared the environmental knowledge they needed for success in the increasingly global supply chains of agri-business. Crop knowledge was extensive and growing in the late nineteenth century, including a series of nascent forecasting methods. Climate knowledge was limited and retreating because of underfunding and spurious theories about solar radiation. But the records of Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) and crop scientists in the Northern Great Plains show that linseed oil manufacturers created extensive knowledge networks to gather crop and some climate information in almost real time. Business associations served an asymmetrical role in these knowledge networks, and some manufacturers, like the members of the Flax Development Committee, treated scientists as a crop reporting service. As Argentina became a major linseed producer the US oilseed sector used public and private intermediaries to develop specialized knowledge of grassland agriculture in both the Prairies and the Pampas. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ADM; agri-business; Argentina; environmental knowledge; forecasting; Great Plains; intermediaries; linseed oil","agroindustry; business; economic history; forecasting method; knowledge; marketing; nineteenth century; vegetable oil; Argentina; Great Plains; Linum usitatissimum","SSHRC: 756-2010-819","MacFadyen, J.; The School of Historical, United States; email: Joshua.MacFadyen@asu.edu","Routledge",00076791,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016933241

Existing solutions are all designed to detect a certain type of RFID anomalies, but lack a general functionality for detecting different types of anomalies. This paper attempts to propose a general framework for anomaly detection in RFID systems, thereby reducing the complexity for readers and tags to implement different anomaly-detection protocols. We introduce a new concept of differential Bloom filter (DBF), which turns physical-layer signal data into a segmented Bloom filter that encodes the IDs of abnormal tags. As a case study, we propose a protocol that builds DBF for identifying all missing tags in an efficient way. We implement a prototype for missing-tag identification using USRP and WISP tags to verify the effectiveness our protocol, and use large-scale simulations for performance evaluation. The results show that our solution can significantly improve time efficiency, when comparing with the best existing work. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Cloning; Data structures; Inventory control; Network layers; Supply chains; Anomaly detection; Inventory management; Large scale simulations; Physical layers; Product tracking; RFID Technology; Tag identification; Time efficiencies; Radio frequency identification (RFID)","BSF: CNS-1115548",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",0743166X,9781509053360,PINFE,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034095902

Three previous studies provided input by determining fibre balances, a terrain factor, and primary and secondary transport travel speeds and efficiencies. Network analysis, combined with raster-based GIS, analysed different primary and secondary transport scenarios. The forest road network was repeatedly refined through theoretical removal of lower-class roads and subsequent upgrades of remaining roads, and the timber resource flowed over the remaining road network to the mill. Four road networks, including the existing and unrefined network, were studied. With sequentially improved secondary transport travel speeds, primary transport efficiency and fibre use, the net financial returns of the various scenarios were determined by applying discounted cash flow analysis (NPV). To address all possible combinations, 144 unique scenarios were created. The highest NPV achieved was R300.8 million associated with a highly upgraded road network and associated fast secondary transport speeds, cable skidder extraction, motor-manual felling and cross-cutting at the merchandising yard, all factors at optimal performance. The lowest NPV was R40.4 million associated with a simplified road network, low secondary transport speeds, cable skidder extraction, mechanised felling, and roadside merchandising and at status quo systems performance. Examination of individual factors found systems performance, secondary transport speeds and road network had the greatest influence, with systems performance and fibre losses providing the largest impact. Secondary transport speed followed as nine of the top 10 NPV scenarios were achieved with the highest possible road design speeds. Higher-class networks consistently outperformed the baseline and simplified scenarios. Harvesting system had limited effect. When operating at peak performance, using a merchandising yard becomes a better choice. There was no clear difference in terms of felling method or skidder type. It is clear that the optimised use of potentially the most productive machine, for example in one system, does not provide the best final results and that it is the basic harmonisation of all factors that must be taken into account. As in all three previous and related studies, the human element played a role. © 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd.","discounted cash flow; fibre balance; forest roads network; net present value; network analysis; primary and secondary transport; skidder efficiency; supply chain management; transport speeds",,,"Ackerman, P.A.; Department of Forest and Wood Science, South Africa; email: packer@sun.ac.za","NISC Pty Ltd",20702620,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011588838

In this study, bibliometric methods were adopted to investigate the research status and trends of organizational constraints. The findings showed that there were 1138 articles and reviews, and 52 high-frequency keywords related to organizational constraints during the period 1980–2016. The research cores were “constraints”, “learning”, “institution”, and “behavior” in the co-occurrence network, and “constraints” played the most significant role. The 52 high-frequency keywords were classified into six clusters: “change and decision-making”, “supply chain and sustainability”, “human system and performance”, “culture and relations”, “entrepreneur and resource”, and “learning and innovation”. Furthermore, the indicators of organizational development (e.g., innovation, supply chain, decision-making, performance, sustainability, and employee behavior) were found to be significantly related to the organizational constraints. Based on these findings, future trends were proposed to maintain the sustainability of organizations.

Demand response management is vital in the smart grid to reduce power generation costs as well as to lower the users' electricity bills. In this paper, we introduce multiple fossil-fuel and multiple renewable energy sources-based utility companies on the supply side, and propose an end-user oriented utility company selection scheme to minimize user costs. We formulate the problem as a game, incorporating the uncertainty associated with the power supply of the renewable sources, and prove that there exists a Nash equilibrium for the game. To further reduce users' costs, we develop a joint scheme by integrating shiftable load scheduling with utility company selection. We model the joint scheme also as a game, and prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium for the game. For both schemes, we propose distributed algorithms for the users to find the equilibrium of the game using only local information. We evaluate our schemes and compare their performances to two other approaches. The results show that our joint utility company selection and shiftable load scheduling scheme incurs the least cost to the users. © 2014 IEEE.","Demand response management; Discrete time Markov chain; Game theory; Nash equilibrium; Renewable energy sources; Smart grid; User cost","Computation theory; Cost reduction; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Fossil fuels; Game theory; Markov processes; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Demand response; Discrete time Markov chains; Nash equilibria; Renewable energy source; Smart grid; User cost; Smart power grids",,"Maharjan, S.; Simula Research Laboratory, Martin Linges vei 17, Norway; email: sabita@simula.no","IEEE Computer Society",21686750,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044209320

Several well pad design configurations and operations are selected for shale well development, and re-stimulation and/or stimulation operations are compared for implementation in different well pad designs. Reservoir simulation output data are incorporated into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model developed in GAMS optimization software. The Strategic MILP model recommends an optimal drilling strategy, schedule for product transportation, and supply chain network configuration that optimizes after-tax profit. Additionally, the management of freshwater and the recycle of wastewater is developed incorporating the spatial variation of total dissolved solids (TDS) composition from multi-well shale pads.

The output of supply chain optimization models is not directly applicable to manage inventories in warehouses. The daily operation is managed through policies that dictate when to replenish the inventory and the ordered amount. The policy parameters are usually obtained through the analysis of historical data or simulation. To address the disconnection between optimization of planning models and inventory policies we propose mixed-integer linear programming formulations to optimize the inventory policy parameters. These formulations can be embedded in SCP models to simultaneously optimize the material flows and the inventory policies.

A formulation based on a competitive leader-follower environment, in which the leader should propose a set of negotiation contracts and, at the same time, predict the follower response (to accept/reject the contract) is proposed. The impact of the follower design decisions over the leader objective is evaluated by fixing the follower's decision variables. Then by applying the Scenario Based Dynamic Negotiation method (considering the associated third parties price uncertainties) a set of feasible solutions is generated. Finally, using the Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality-IV method, the set of feasible solutions are evaluated under multiple defined criteria (including economic and environmental) in order to select a unique, optimal negotiation contract and its associated sustainable solution. This solution properly represents the leader's and follower's interests under a win-win negotiation partnership despite the uncontrollable/unpredicted behaviours resulted from the follower's decisions as well as third party changing prices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Decentralized environment; Decision making; Negotiation; Uncertainty",,,,"Elsevier B.V.",15707946,,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041403979

The proposed model exploits mathematical programming techniques to simultaneously optimize the performance of large-scale bioenergy SCs in the presence of conflicting objectives (economic and environmental). Since very few works have addressed the multi-objective optimization of bioenergy SCs with economic and environmental impact factors, the proposed MILP model extends the traditional multi-objective approaches by considering the electricity cogeneration and its impact on the conflicting objectives of the whole system. Bioenergy Sugar cane national SC is considered for this case. The electricity generation is supposed to satisfy the sugar mill energy requirements plus public network. The decisions obtained are the optimal sugar and biomass feedstock locations, sugar and ethanol production, and electricity generation levels that maximize the Net Present Value (NPV) and minimize the environmental impacts, simultaneously.

In this sense, the chemical and pharmaceutical industry often incinerates high-calorific waste residues as a part of waste treatment, thus allowing for recovering a fraction of the combustion heat. Although a systematical management of such waste-to-energy facilities can decrease the consumption of primary energy sources in large integrated chemical sites, supply chain aspects should also be taken into account when planning their operation. Precisely, smaller enterprises often do not have the possibilities to operate own treatment facilities and have to outsource the treatment of their residuals to these sites. Consequently, the impact of waste shipments becomes extremely relevant once a broader network perspective is considered, in terms of both costs and energy. This work constitutes a first step in studying new opportunities arising from investments concerning the expansion of both incineration and temporary storage capacity, as well as new synergies for multi-site industrial waste-to-energy networks under different cost allocation models. Given a set of waste streams with information about amounts and composition, and a set of incineration sites, a mathematical model is proposed to determine relevant investment and long-term operational strategies for a network of existing industrial incineration plants and waste-generating enterprises grouped in regions. The methodology has been tested in collaboration with industrial and institutional partners. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","energy; mathematical optimization; planning; waste incineration; waste-to-energy",,,,"Elsevier B.V.",15707946,,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041395570

To address this challenge the present paper proposes the improvement of the scenario tree approach through the use of two scenario reduction methods.

However, many ERIs struggle to succeed in technology transfer. This study describes the development of a university technology transfer supply chain network sustainability tool that private and public ERIs can use to become more self-reliant financially. Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are ERIs and are used as a case study. HBCUs lag behind their peer non-HBCUs because historically they have been under-served and were originally established largely as teaching and blue-collar trade schools. Some doctoral HBCUs desire to strengthen their research activities. Systems dynamics is the process of combining the theory, method, and philosophy necessary to analyze the behavior of a system in order to provide a common foundation that can be applied whenever it is desired to understand and influence how things change over time. Applying the systems dynamics approach, a budget resource planning tool was developed using a linear programming optimization technique. This study illustrates that classic industrial uses of linear programming optimization techniques can uniquely be used to optimize budget resource planning for sustainable HBCU supply chain networks and other emerging research institutions.

Disruptions in coronary blood flow contribute to cardiac disease, a major cause of premature death worldwide. The generation of treatments for cardiovascular disease will be aided by a deeper understanding of the developmental processes that underpin coronary vessel formation. From an ENU mutagenesis screen, we have isolated a mouse mutant displaying embryonic hydrocephalus and cardiac defects (EHC). Positional cloning and candidate gene analysis revealed that the EHC phenotype results from a point mutation in a splice donor site of the Myh10 gene, which encodes NMHC IIB. Complementation testing confirmed that the Myh10 mutation causes the EHC phenotype. Characterisation of the EHC cardiac defects revealed abnormalities in myocardial development, consistent with observations from previously generated NMHC IIB null mouse lines. Analysis of the EHC mutant hearts also identified defects in the formation of the coronary vasculature. We attribute the coronary vessel abnormalities to defective epicardial cell function, as the EHC epicardium displays an abnormal cell morphology, reduced capacity to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and impaired migration of epicardial-derived cells (EPDCs) into the myocardium. Our studies on the EHC mutant demonstrate a requirement for NMHC IIB in epicardial function and coronary vessel formation, highlighting the importance of this protein in cardiac development and ultimately, embryonic survival. © 2017 Ridge et al.",,"myosin; non muscle myosin IIB; unclassified drug; myosin heavy chain; myosin IIB; nonmuscle myosin type IIB heavy chain; angiogenesis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cardiac muscle cell; cell migration; cell structure; congenital heart malformation; controlled study; coronary blood vessel; embryo; epicardial derived cell; epicardium; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; heart development; hydrocephalus; mouse; Myh10 gene; nonhuman; phenotype; point mutation; animal; cardiac muscle; cell differentiation; coronary blood vessel; embryo development; genetics; growth, development and aging; human; knockout mouse; mammalian embryo; metabolism; mutation; pathology; pericardium; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Coronary Vessels; Embryo, Mammalian; Embryonic Development; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Humans; Hydrocephalus; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Mutation; Myocardium; Myosin Heavy Chains; Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIB; Pericardium",,"Hentges, K.E.; Division of Evolution and Genome Sciences, United Kingdom; email: Kathryn.hentges@manchester.ac.uk","Public Library of Science",15537390,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033221073

Consequently, local production disruptions, for instance caused by extreme weather events, are likely to induce indirect losses along supply chains with potentially global repercussions. These complex loss dynamics represent a challenge for comprehensive disaster risk assessments. Here, we introduce the numerical agent-based model acclimate designed to analyze the cascading of economic losses in the global supply network. Using national sectors as agents, we apply the model to study the global propagation of losses induced by stylized disasters. We find that indirect losses can become comparable in size to direct ones, but can be efficiently mitigated by warehousing and idle capacities. Consequently, a comprehensive risk assessment cannot focus solely on first-tier suppliers, but has to take the whole supply chain into account. To render the supply network climate-proof, national adaptation policies have to be complemented by international adaptation efforts. In that regard, our model can be employed to assess reasonable leverage points and to identify dynamic bottlenecks inaccessible to static analyses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agent-based modeling; Disaster impact analysis; Dynamic input-output model; Economic network; Higher-order effects; Resilience",,"603864; City; H2020: 641811; SAW-2013-PIK-5","Otto, C.; Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Telegraphenberg A56, Germany; email: christian.otto@pik-potsdam.de","Elsevier B.V.",01651889,,JEDCD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032025424

The ethnography analyses cooperation networks between organic food producers’ and consumers’ involving different nodes of community gardening initiatives, self-employed growers, local farmers and all of them under a unique cooperative integrating a community economy. The result it is a myriad of exchange practices ranging from reciprocity and barter to market exchange without intermediaries through on-line platforms. Along these exchanges different options of currency intervene giving rise to novel social and cooperative relations. Similar initiatives in Norway show less variation and are less experimental regarding forms of payment but share similarities in relation to material articulations, concerns and forms of alternative practice. Although these novel forms do not represent a complete break from the more standardized supply chains, and hence from the oppositions/contradictions of production and consumption, the participants see themselves as contributing to a more general process of de-commodification of food. We explore the extent to which the meaning and moral values are mutually constituted in relation to socioeconomic exchanges and environmental caring that each person experiences based on different forms of cooperation and reciprocity. Food, we suggest, is more than a commodity on the market that we may influence through our role as consumers.

Rheological tests on all composite gels (MP with SDF) showed the visco-elastic nature of MP, but the G′ significantly increased with contents of SDF and with particle size (P < 0.05). However, the δ exhibited the opposite effect. Light microscopy suggested that SDF affected moisture distribution in the gel by drawing water from MP and homogenously embedded in gelation. It is proposed that during the heating the more concentrated MP promoted the unfolding of MP chains and facilitated the formation of β-sheet instead of α-helices, leading to a compact and homogenous three-dimensioned network.

Pancreatic beta cell functional maturation occurs after birth and implies transcriptional changes triggered by a shift in the nutritional supply that occurs at weaning, enabling the adaptation of insulin secretion. So far, the developmental timing and exact mechanisms involved in the initiation of the circadian clock in the growing pancreatic islets have never been addressed. Methods: Circadian gene expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR in islets of rats at different postnatal ages up to 3 months, and by in vitro bioluminescence recording in newborn (10-day-old) and adult (3-month-old) islets. The effect of the microRNAs miR-17-5p and miR-29b-3p on the expression of target circadian genes was assessed in newborn rat islets transfected with microRNA antisense or mimic oligonucleotides, and luciferase reporter assays were performed on the rat insulin-secreting cell line INS832/13 to determine a direct effect. The global regulatory network between microRNAs and circadian genes was computationally predicted. Results: We found up to a sixfold-change in the 24 h transcriptional oscillations and overall expression of Clock, Npas2, Bmal1, Bmal2, Rev-erbα, Per1, Per2, Per3 and Cry2 between newborn and adult rat islets. Synchronisation of the clock machinery in cultured islet cells revealed a delayed cell-autonomous rhythmicity of about 1.5 h in newborn compared with adult rats. Computational predictions unveiled the existence of a complex regulatory network linking over 40 microRNAs displaying modifications in their expression profiles during postnatal beta cell maturation and key core-clock genes. In agreement with these computational predictions, we demonstrated that miR-17-5p and miR-29b-3p directly regulated circadian gene expression in the maturing islet cells of 10-day-old rats. Conclusions/interpretation: These data show that the circadian clock is not fully operational in newborn islets and that microRNAs potently contribute to its regulation during postnatal beta cell maturation. Defects in this process may have long-term consequences on circadian physiology and pancreatic islet function, favouring the manifestation of metabolic diseases such as diabetes. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Circadian clock; MicroRNAs; Pancreatic islets; Postnatal maturation","cryptochrome 2; insulin; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 175p; microRNA 29b; nuclear receptor NR1D1; PER1 protein; PER2 protein; PER3 protein; protein; transcription factor ARNTL; transcription factor Bmal2; transcription factor CLOCK; transcription factor Npas2; unclassified drug; circadian rhythm signaling protein; microRNA; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bioluminescence; cell maturation; circadian rhythm; controlled study; female; gene expression; in vitro study; insulin release; male; molecular clock; newborn; nonhuman; oscillation; pancreas islet beta cell; postnatal development; priority journal; protein expression; rat; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; animal; circadian rhythm; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; pancreas islet; physiology; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Circadian Clocks; Circadian Rhythm Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Islets of Langerhans; Male; MicroRNAs; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley","FFRD; SNF: 310030-146138, 310030-169480, 31003A-166700, CRSII3-154405; SFD","Regazzi, R.; Department of Fundamental Neurosciences, Rue du Bugnon 9, Switzerland; email: romano.regazzi@unil.ch","Springer Verlag",0012186X,,DBTGA,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021839134

An inventory system with stochastic demand in which the supply of the product is randomly disrupted in distribution centers, is considered in this paper. Partial backordering is used in case stock out occurs by considering the probability of the confronting defects in distribution centers in time of disruption. We presented a bi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model. The first objective minimizes the locating, routing and transportation costs and inventory components which consist of ordering, holding and partial backordering costs. The second objective is to minimize the total failure costs related to disrupted distribution centers that leads to reliability of the supply chain network. Because of NP-hardness of the proposed model, we modified Archived Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (AMOSA) meta-heuristic algorithm to solve the bi-objective problem in large scales and compared the results with three other algorithms. To improve performance of the algorithms Taguchi method is used to tune parameters. Finally, several numerical examples are generated to evaluate solution methods and five multi-objective metrics are calculated to compare results of the algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","AMOSA; Disruption risk; Location-inventory-routing; NSGA-II; Partial backordering; Reliable facility location","Costs; Heuristic algorithms; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Numerical methods; Probability distributions; Simulated annealing; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Taguchi methods; Warehouses; AMOSA; Facility locations; Inventory routing; NSGA-II; Partial backordering; Location",,"Bozorgi-Amiri, A.; School of Industrial Engineering, Iran; email: alibozorgi@ut.ac.ir","Elsevier Ltd",15684946,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021167724

During the development of the predictive model it became evident that only the tip of the iceberg, so to speak, has been uncovered. The rhino poaching problem is even more complex than was initially thought and this paper serves as a reflective piece on how the research methodology for the complex and poorly understood rhino poaching problem was shifted towards developing a common understanding of major drivers and interactions, to allow for pre-emptive action on a variety of fronts. The global drivers dictating the rhino horn supply chain such as human trafficking and other socio-economic factors cannot easily be captured in a model of causal certainties. This is in spite of the fact that the motivation of the individual poachers may reduce to greed or the need to provide for their families. Although the authors initially thought that it would be possible to model these causalities it became clear that the system is highly reflexive and adaptive. The system has feedback and recursive causal internals that self-regulate by changing in response to the environment. As interventions are introduced, the system will try to respond to mitigate the effects or impact of the change which makes predictive causal modelling very challenging. The paper reflects on this understanding derived from the development of a methodology that combines different versions of a causal Bayesian Network model with a systems framework drawn from an integral ecology perspective. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Rhino poaching; Systems engineering; Transdisciplinary approach","Bayesian analysis; developing world; mammal; modeling; poaching; research work; resource management; socioeconomic conditions; wildlife management; Agonidae",,"Koen, H.; Defence Peace Safety and Security (DPSS), PO Box 395, South Africa; email: hkoen@csir.co.za","Elsevier Ltd",00163287,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020454007

Integrated forward/reverse supply chain management is treated as a necessary response to the call for corporate sustainability in logistics networks. Also, due to growing environmental and economic concerns, the recycling of used products is becoming a common practice. It is recently remarkable that applying cross-docking in forward logistics has been recognized as an important field of performance improvement, however, approaches to consider this strategy in the both forward and reverse contexts (simultaneously) are far lacking. To cover these gaps, this paper indicates how cross-docking can be efficiently implemented in a forward/reverse structure, and in this regards, proposes an integrated multi-product supply chain network. To study the problem, we firstly present a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to minimize total costs. Secondly, to solve the obtained model, we use the general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) software. Furthermore, the model performance is evaluated through comparing the case of using forward/reverse cross-docking with that of not applying this strategy (classical approach) in the network configuration—in terms of defining two theories. Finally, the significant outcomes resulted from utilizing forward/reverse cross-docking in the network are discussed. Considered the above requirements, the model increases the efficiency of the integrated forward/reverse logistics. © 2017, German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP).","Efficiency; Forward/reverse cross-docking; Integrated supply chain; Mixed integer linear programming; Multi-product network; Theory analysis","Efficiency; Logistics; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Crossdocking; Integrated supply chain; Mixed integer linear programming; Multi-products; Theory analysis; Integer programming",,"Rezaei, S.; Department of Industrial Engineering, Iran; email: Saeidrezaei.ie@gmail.com","Springer Verlag",09446524,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019869849

Therefore, efficient conversion of xylose to ethanol is essential for the commercialization of lignocellulosic ethanol, which may provide an ideal alternative to fossil fuels in the future. ZLYRHZ7 is a fusant produced by protoplast fusion between two different yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae W5 and Candida shehatae 20335, which is able to utilize xylose to produce ethanol. To improve ethanol production and to quantitatively analyze metabolic pathway in ZLYRHZ7, we used high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to assess the utilization rates of xylose, xylitol, and xylulose, and to measure ethanol yields using xylose, xylitol, and xylulose as sole carbon sources. The ethanol yields reached 0.549 ± 0.003, 0.567 ± 0.003 and 0.544 ± 0.005 g/g in 72 h, which indicated that the metabolic pathways from xylose to xylitol, xylitol to xylulose, and xylulose to ethanol, respectively, were functional.

However, in complex supply chains, it is not obvious how best to deploy them in a coordinated approach to minimize cost and to provide a high service level. In this paper, we consider production smoothing and its effect on inter-stage demand flow in a supply network that is capable of expediting shipments between its stages. We model a general network of production and inventory stages, which allows production smoothing to be optimized in realistic network configurations. We incorporate parameters that can significantly affect smoothing, expediting and safety stock decisions but are not considered in most multi-echelon models, including reorder frequencies and inter-stage demand correlation. We assume that services from inventories and production are guaranteed by performing expediting (at additional cost) in times of shortages. Under such a setting, the model quantifies the trade-offs between production smoothness, expediting and safety stocks, and determines their optimal deployment in a network. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the model's application and capability; in addition, we provide insights on the choice of freight expediting versus safety stock and their interplay with smoothing. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Expedited freight; Guaranteed service; Multi-echelon inventory; Production smoothing; Supply chain management","Commerce; Coordination reactions; Supply chain management; Complex supply chain; Expedited freight; Guaranteed service; Multi-echelon inventory; Network configuration; Numerical experiments; Production and inventory; Production smoothing; Economic and social effects",,"Teo, C.-C.; School of Civil & Environmental Engineering, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore; email: teocc@ntu.edu.sg","Elsevier B.V.",03772217,,EJORD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016413868

In industry, this kind of problems inevitably required a multi-objective analysis to evaluate the environmental impact in addition to the economic performance. Bio-based processes have the potential to enhance the sustainability level of the energy sector. Nevertheless, such processes very often show variable conditions and present an uncertain behavior. The approaches presented for solving multi-objective problems under uncertainty have neglected the potential effects of different quality streams on the overall system. Here, it is presented an alternative approach, based on a State Task Network formulation, capable of optimizing under uncertain conditions, considering multiple selection criteria and accounting for the material quality effect.

The vast majority of Australia's current CSG developments and reserves are situated in agriculture-rich, cattle-grazing regions; therefore, it is critical to identify symbiotic relationships between agri-based industries and the CSG industry to achieve beneficial coexistence. The CSG industry has generated infrastructure such as gas and water pipelines, water storage and treatment facilities, transportation and electricity networks, and other CSG-associated services (e.g., accommodation, education, and medical facilities), which have the potential to improve regional communities and facilitate economic growth. This article aims to investigate these coexistence opportunities, including the use of by-products (mainly water produced during CSG extraction), infrastructure, and services generated from the CSG industry, which can provide value to the local industries. Focusing on the cattle value chain, the authors suggest an agri-based industrial coexistence model that indicates material-water flows and optimized utilization of infrastructure that not only promote coexistence between the agribusiness and CSG industries, but expand the cattle value-chain productivity in rural Queensland. A water balance has been conducted around the suggested coexistence model with the aim of quantifying water flows, to indicate the supply versus demand scenario associated with CSG-sourced water production. The results of the water balance indicate that CSG water supply has the potential to meet the requirements of agribusiness promoting industries. © 2016 by Yale University","cattle value chain; coal bed methane; coal seam gas; energy-food nexus; gas & agricultural coexistence; industrial ecology","Agriculture; Chains; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Economics; Flow of water; Gases; Hydraulics; Methane; Water supply; Water treatment; Asia Pacific region; Economic growths; Electricity networks; Energy-food nexus; Industrial ecology; Medical facility; Symbiotic relationship; Value chains; Coal bed methane; agroindustry; cattle; coal seam; coalbed methane; energy; food; gas industry; industrial ecology; infrastructure; optimization; rural economy; supply chain management; water budget; Australia; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim; Queensland; Bos",,"Mehreen, S.U.; School of Mechanical & Mining Engineering, Australia; email: s.mehreen@uq.edu.au","Blackwell Publishing",10881980,,JINEF,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007589322

In this context, mathematical models for the prediction of the evolution of an ongoing outbreak are of paramount importance. Here, we test a real-time forecasting framework that readily integrates new information as soon as available and periodically issues an updated forecast. The spread of cholera is modeled by a spatially-explicit scheme that accounts for the dynamics of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals hosted in different local communities connected through hydrologic and human mobility networks. The framework presents two major innovations for cholera modeling: the use of a data assimilation technique, specifically an ensemble Kalman filter, to update both state variables and parameters based on the observations, and the use of rainfall forecasts to force the model. The exercise of simulating the state of the system and the predictive capabilities of the novel tools, set at the initial phase of the 2010 Haitian cholera outbreak using only information that was available at that time, serves as a benchmark. Our results suggest that the assimilation procedure with the sequential update of the parameters outperforms calibration schemes based on Markov chain Monte Carlo. Moreover, in a forecasting mode the model usefully predicts the spatial incidence of cholera at least one month ahead. The performance decreases for longer time horizons yet allowing sufficient time to plan for deployment of medical supplies and staff, and to evaluate alternative strategies of emergency management. © 2016 The Authors","Cholera; Climate forecast system; Data assimilation; Epidemiological model; Rainfall forecast","Climate models; Diseases; Human resource management; Markov processes; Rain; Risk management; Weather forecasting; Cholera; Climate forecasts; Data assimilation; Epidemiological modeling; Rainfall forecasts; Forecasting; calibration; cholera; climate prediction; data assimilation; ensemble forecasting; epidemiology; numerical model; rainfall; real time; Haiti; Hispaniola","SNF: 138104","Bertuzzo, E.; Laboratory of Ecohydrology, Civil and Environmental Engineering, École Polytechinque Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; email: enrico.bertuzzo@unive.it","Elsevier Ltd",03091708,,AWRED,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006056338

However, even though the components of the agrifood systems are all strongly interconnected, the design processes to improve their sustainabilities are still mostly managed separately. This frequently leads to innovating in one domain in order to adapt to the constraints or specifications of the other, such as tweaking the farming systems to address processing issues, or the other way round. The objectives of this paper are first to show the limits of such an organization, and second to provide a heuristic framework to organize the design of coupled innovations, by reconnecting the dynamics of innovation in agriculture and food, with a view to improving the whole agrifood system. Our framework highlights that working at this level requires designing in raw production, exchange, processing, and consumption, while taking into account synergies or antagonisms between upstream and downstream. Thus, the innovations are not only technological – e.g. concerning cropping systems or processing – but also organizational and institutional. Based on several examples, in the cereal, linseed, legume, and market-gardening productions, at the junction of agriculture and food sciences, we also show that this perspective of designing coupled innovations calls for a renewed research agenda. Three main domains are thus questioned. First, coupling requires an innovative design process for radical innovations, challenging the coordination of exploration in both domains. Second, the development of “innovation niches” outside the dominant sociotechnical regime, in order to bypass the lock-in from the dominant system, faces the difficulty of favoring the building of renewed networks of actors, which were used to working separately so far. Third, the necessity to share expectations and knowledge, and to design together innovations that suit all sides, leads to making several recommendations for the governance of the design process. Finally, we conclude that the need for innovation in the agrifood systems requires going beyond the historical specialization of skills, and the usual forms of coordination between designers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Agroecology; Food system; Innovative design; Lock-in; Open innovation; Value chain","agroecology; agroindustry; design; farming system; heuristics; innovation; specialization; supply chain management; sustainability; technological change","ANR: ANR-13-AGRO","Meynard, J.-M.; INRA, France; email: meynard@grignon.inra.fr","Elsevier Ltd",0308521X,,AGSYD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996599477

In contrast to conventional cooperative networks, relays in the considered network have no embedded energy supply. They need to rely on the energy harvested from the signals broadcasted by the source for their cooperative information transmission. Based on this structure, a two-step selection scheme is proposed considering both channel state information (CSI) and battery status of relays. Assuming each relay has infinite or finite energy storage for accumulating the energy, we use the infinite or finite Markov chain to capture the evolution of relay batteries and certain simplified assumptions to reduce computational complexity of the Markov chain analysis. The approximate closed-form expressions for the average capacity of the proposed scheme are derived. All theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations. The impacts of the system parameters, such as relay or user number, energy harvesting threshold and battery size, on the capacity performance are extensively investigated. Results show that although the performance of our scheme is inferior to the optimal joint selection scheme, it is still a practical scheme because its complexity is much lower than that of the optimal scheme. © 2017 KSII.","Cooperative Communication; Energy harvesting; Finite markov chain; Infinite markov chain; Two-step selection","Chains; Channel state information; Communication channels (information theory); Complex networks; Electric batteries; Energy harvesting; Markov processes; Capacity performance; Closed-form expression; Cooperative networks; Finite Markov chain; Information transmission; Markov chain analysis; Multi-user networks; Two-step selection; Cooperative communication","BSQD2012055; xkj201306; J15LN57","Guo, W.; College of Physics and Engineering, China; email: gud2001@163.com","Korean Society for Internet Information",19767277,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030835732

Moreover, the frequently adjustment of MPS can induce fluctuation of production and increasing of inventory cost as well as decreasing service level of customer. Most of studies about instability of MPS use freezing method and rolling procedure to adjust MPS periodically. Freezing is the proportion of planning horizon being frozen, whereas rolling procedure is a method replanning periodically of MPS using newly updated demand data. This study is focused on interval freezing length as an issue of decision making. In supply chain, a manufacturer is supported by suppliers to supply material requirement. Since a manufacturer plan production schedule on MPS the freezing interval is determined that will be informed to suppliers which supply the material requirement. In previous research, the freezing interval is decided by manufacturer as necessary decision maker. This decision must be followed by suppliers though it is not beneficial for them. It can be concluded that this condition is no win-win situation. Hence, this research proposes that suppliers will be involved as decision maker besides a manufacturer so the interval freezing is decided by two-side decision maker. © 2017 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,"Freezing; Manufacture; Production control; Supply chains; Customer orders; Freezing methods; Master production scheduling; Material requirements; Planning horizons; Production schedule; Rolling procedure; Supplier networks; Decision making",,,"EDP Sciences",2261236X,,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031298799

It is intended as a standalone book in a series that covers the Internet of Things activities of the IERC-Internet of Things European Research Cluster, including both research and technological innovation, validation and deployment. The book builds on the ideas put forward by the European Research Cluster, the IoT European Platform Initiative (IoT-EPI) and the IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme, presenting global views and state-of-the-art results regarding the challenges facing IoT research, innovation, development and deployment in the next years. Hyperconnected environments integrating industrial/business/consumer IoT technologies and applications require new IoT open systems architectures integrated with network architecture (a knowledge-centric network for IoT), IoT system design and open, horizontal and interoperable platforms managing things that are digital, automated and connected and that function in real-time with remote access and control based on Internet-enabled tools. The IoT is bridging the physical world with the virtual world by combining augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to support the physical-digital integrations in the Internet of mobile things based on sensors/actuators, communication, analytics technologies, cyber-physical systems, software, cognitive systems and IoT platforms with multiple functionalities. These IoT systems have the potential to understand, learn, predict, adapt and operate autonomously. They can change future behaviour, while the combination of extensive parallel processing power, advanced algorithms and data sets feed the cognitive algorithms that allow the IoT systems to develop new services and propose new solutions. IoT technologies are moving into the industrial space and enhancing traditional industrial platforms with solutions that break free of device-, operating system- and protocol-dependency. Secure edge computing solutions replace local networks, web services replace software, and devices with networked programmable logic controllers (NPLCs) based on Internet protocols replace devices that use proprietary protocols. Information captured by edge devices on the factory floor is secure and accessible from any location in real time, opening the communication gateway both vertically (connecting machines across the factory and enabling the instant availability of data to stakeholders within operational silos) and horizontally (with one framework for the entire supply chain, across departments, business units, global factory locations and other markets). End-to-end security and privacy solutions in IoT space require agile, context-aware and scalable components with mechanisms that are both fluid and adaptive. The convergence of IT (information technology) and OT (operational technology) makes security and privacy by default a new important element where security is addressed at the architecture level, across applications and domains, using multi-layered distributed security measures. Blockchain is transforming industry operating models by adding trust to untrusted environments, providing distributed security mechanisms and transparent access to the information in the chain.

This paper discusses a simulation study of a selected road traffic system that will contribute to the air pollution if in the congestion state. Road traffic congestion (RTC) can be caused by a temporary obstruction, a permanent capacity bottleneck in the network itself, and stochastic fluctuation in demand within a particular sector of the network, leading to spillback and queue propagation. A discrete-event simulation model is developed to represent the real traffic light control (TLC) system condition during peak hours. Certain performance measures such as average waiting time and queue length were measured using the simulation model. Existing system uses pre-set cycle time to control the light changes which is fixed time cycle. In this research, we test several other combination of pre-set cycle time with the objective to find the best system. In addition, we plan to use a combination of the pre-set cycle time and a proximity sensor which have the authority to manipulate the cycle time of the lights. The sensors work in such situation when the street seems to have less occupied vehicles, obviously it may not need a normal cycle for green light, and automatically change the cycle to street where vehicle is present. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Discrete event simulation; Roads and streets; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Transportation; Average waiting-time; Discrete-event simulation model; Environmental issues; Green supply chain; Performance measure; Road traffic system; Simulation studies; Stochastic fluctuation; Traffic congestion","UUM",,"Institute of Physics Publishing",17426588,,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030663800

Therefore, current study is aimed to determine an optimal closed loop supply chain network, which is composed of multiple producers, remanufacturers, intermediate centers and customer centers. Furthermore, uncertainty in the demand and uncertainty in the quantity of returned products is considered simultaneously in the network to make it significantly useful in the uncertain environment. A novel genetic artificial bee colony (GABC) algorithm is introduced with a new food source representation for the current problem. The proposed GABC algorithm considered neighbor food sources for local search and used crossover and mutation operations of genetic algorithm to enhance the exploration ability of the proposed algorithm. Taguchi method is employed to compute the optimal parameters of GABC for two different size test problems taken from literature and a Case problem which are modified according to the current research problem. The performance of presented GABC algorithm is tested by comparing the results of considered test problems with the results obtained from the original artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA). Moreover, to test the robustness of the proposed GABC algorithm, different scenarios of small and large size problems based on the quantity of demand and variations in demand are made to perform the experiments. Results indicate that proposed GABC outperforms standard ABC and GA in different scenarios to give smaller value of the total cost of network and gives more robust results to give smaller variations in the total cost of network due to uncertain variations in the demand, as compared to original ABC and GA.d © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Close loop supply chain network; Demand uncertainty; Genetic artificial bee colony algorithm; Remanufacturing","Evolutionary algorithms; Optimization; Supply chains; Taguchi methods; Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colony algorithms; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Closed-loop supply chain networks; Demand uncertainty; Remanufacturing; Supply chain network; Uncertain environments; Genetic algorithms","NSFC: 51275190, 51561125002, 51575211, 71131004, 71471071; MOST; HUST: 2014TS038; ","Saif, U.; State Key Lab of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology, Pakistan; email: saifullah47@yahoo.com","Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024121360

The encryption card provides hardware cryptographic services for users and is believed to be superior to software cryptography. However, we cannot use the encryption card directly in the user domain because of the complicated virtualization mechanisms and the security problems about the user key and the user private data flow. To address these challenges, we propose a new virtualization architecture to ensure the trustworthiness of encryption cards. First, we design a privacy preserving model to ensure the security of the dynamic schedule of encryption cards. Second, we present a hardware trust verification procedure based on the trusted platform module to supply a trusted virtualization hardware foundation. Third, we provide a series of security protocols to establish a trusted chain between users and encryption cards. Finally, we give security proofs of the encryption card virtualization architecture.

As large consumers of this corn, corporations in the ethanol and animal protein industries are increasingly assessing and reporting sustainability impacts across their supply chains to identify, prioritize, and communicate sustainability risks and opportunities material to their operations. In doing so, many have discovered that the direct impacts of their owned operations are dwarfed by those upstream in the supply chain, requiring transparency and knowledge about environmental impacts along the supply chains. Life cycle assessments (LCAs) have been used to identify hotspots of environmental impacts at national levels, yet these provide little subnational information necessary for guiding firms’ specific supply networks. In this paper, our Food System Supply-Chain Sustainability (FoodS3) model connects spatial, firm-specific demand of corn purchasers with upstream corn production in the United States through a cost minimization transport model. This provides a means to link county-level corn production in the United States to firm-specific demand locations associated with downstream processing facilities. Our model substantially improves current LCA assessment efforts that are confined to broad national or state level impacts. In drilling down to subnational levels of environmental impacts that occur over heterogeneous areas and aggregating these landscape impacts by specific supply networks, targeted opportunities for improvements to the sustainability performance of supply chains are identified. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

Power, gas and heat systems are becoming tightly interlinked with each other in ESI. The dispatching strategy of local-area ESI has significant impact on its operation. In this paper, a local-area ESI operational scheduling model based on conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is proposed to minimize expected operational cost, which considers the uncertainty of energy supply-side and demand-side as well as multi-energy network constraints, including electrical network, thermal network and gas network. The risk cost is analyzed comprehensively under the condition of under- or overestimated cost. On this basis, a hybrid method combining particle swarm optimization with interior point algorithm is executed to compute the optimal solutions of two-stage multi-period mixed-integer convex model.

An originality of the work is to combine an analytical model allowing to build feasible scenarios and a multi-criteria approach for assessing these scenarios.

Unlike the traditional approaches, we present a method evaluating each possible supply scenario through performance-based and risk-based decision criteria, involving both qualitative and quantitative factors, in order to clearly separate the performance of a scenario and the risk taken if it is adopted. Since the decision-maker often cannot provide crisp values for some critical data, fuzzy sets theory is suggested in order to model vague information based on subjective expertise. Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution is used to determine both the performance and risk measures correlated to each possible tactical plan. The applicability and tractability of the proposed approach is shown on an illustrative example and a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the influence of criteria weights on the selection of the procurement–production plan. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","fuzzy logic; fuzzy sets theory; multi-criteria decision-making; procurement; risk management; supply chain management","Decision theory; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy set theory; Fuzzy sets; Planning; Production control; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chain management; Fuzzy - Multi criteria decision making; Fuzzy sets theory; Multi criteria decision making; Multi-criteria approach; Parallel manufacturing; procurement; Risk management process; Traditional approaches; Decision making",,"Grabot, B.; LGP, France; email: bernard.grabot@enit.fr","Taylor and Francis Ltd.",00207543,,IJPRB,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017035479

Supply chain management system is proposed to handle the increasing complexity and improve the efficiency of flows of goods. It is also useful to prevent potential frauds and guarantee trade compliance. Currently, most companies maintain their own IT system for supply chain management. However, this approach has some limitations that prevent one to get most of the supply chain information. Using emerging decentralized ledger technology to build supply chain management system is a promising direction. However, decentralized ledger usually suffers from low performance and lack of capability to protect information stored on the ledger. To overcome these challenges, we propose CoC, a novel supply chain management system based on hybrid decentralized ledger.

In contrast to conventional cooperative networks, relays in the considered network have no embedded energy supply; they need to rely on the energy harvested from the signals broadcasted by the source for their cooperative NOMA transmission. Based on this structure, a new relay selection scheme is proposed, considering both channel state information (CSI) and battery status of relays. Assuming each relay has infinite or finite energy storage for accumulating energy, we use the infinite or finite Markov chain to capture the evolution of relay batteries and certain simplified assumptions to reduce computational complexity of the Markov chain analysis. The approximate closed-form expressions for the outage probability of the proposed scheme are derived therefrom. All theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations. The impacts of the system parameters, such as relay number, energy harvesting threshold and battery size, on the performance are extensively investigated. © 2017 by the authors.","Cooperative communication; Energy harvesting; Markov chain; Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)","Chains; Channel state information; Communication channels (information theory); Electric batteries; Energy harvesting; Markov processes; Amplify-and-forward; Closed-form expression; Cooperative networks; Finite Markov chain; Markov chain analysis; Multi-user networks; Multiple access; Outage probability; Cooperative communication",,"Guo, W.; College of Physics and Engineering, China; email: gud2001@qfnu.edu.cn","MDPI AG",20782489,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030166469

While it is useful to localize a device simply by its communication signals, this is very difficult to do with Sigfox because of wide area and ultra narrowband nature. On the other hand, installing a satellite localization element on the device greatly increases its power consumption. We investigated using information about nearbyWi-Fi access points as a way to localize the asset over the Sigfox network, so without connecting to those Wi-Fi networks. This paper reports the location error that can be achieved by this type of outdoor localization. By using a combination of two databases, we could localize the device on all 36 test locations with a median location error of 39m. This shows that the localization accuracy of this method is promising enough to warrant further study, most specifically the minimal power consumption. © 2017 by the authors.

Therefore, in this study, with the aim of supplier selection by resilience approach and with an extensive review of the literature, an initial conceptual model is proposed. Then, the model was localized using the opinions of experts in a large industrial unit in Wood and Paper Industry. Subsequently, the importance level of the elements effective in resilient supplier selection using Fuzzy Analytic Network Process was determined. Using these elements, the resiliency level of the suppliers of the company was specified through the grey VIKOR method. Based on the obtained results, variation in price, vulnerability, supplier's capacity limit, supplier's capability limit, visibility, supplier's raw material acquisition difficulties and on time delivery were respectively the most important sub-criteria in resilient supplier selection in this unit.

These advances are also helping to monitor smart cities and making our living environments workable. However, sensor nodes are constrained in energy supply if they have no constant power supply. Moreover, communication links can be easily failed because of unequal node energy depletion. The energy constraints and link failures affect the performance and quality of the sensor network. Therefore, designing a routing protocol that minimizes energy consumption and maximizes the network lifetime should be considered in the design of the routing protocol for WSN.

Recent literature suggests performance benefits from combining these innovations. Within supply chain (SC) partnerships, that use BIM–hereinafter called BIM-enabled SC partnerships–various formal and informal dimensions influence the inter-organizational relations. To understand such partnerships, a mixed method approach featuring case studies and social networks analysis (SNA) was deployed. SNA was an analytic approach to explore the complex relations within two Dutch BIM-enabled projects. The inter-organizational relations were asymmetrical and formal in Case A, emphasizing transactions, whereas in Case B, they were asymmetrical and informal, emphasizing relations. The transactional-oriented partnership had greater control over contractual issues, but their formal relations were not sufficient for diffusing BIM-related knowledge across the chain. Conversely, the relational-oriented partnership engaged the partners in BIM by informal means, e.g. dense communication and BIM-related peer-learning across all tiers. Symmetric and jointly fostered formal and informal relations contribute to SC integration. The study extends the knowledge base of SCM and BIM, by offering real-world data on their combination. Besides providing new insights into SNA deployment for BIM-related research, it also offers a novel constructivist and inter-organizational perspective on the old concept of SCM. © 2017 The Author(s).

Yet the supply chains of poor countries face more frequent disruptions - delivery failures, faulty parts, delays, power outages, theft and government failures - that systematically thwart the production process. To understand how these disruptions affect economic development, we modelled an evolving input-output network in which disruptions spread contagiously among optimizing agents. The key finding was that a poverty trap can emerge: agents adapt to frequent disruptions by producing simpler, less valuable goods, yet disruptions persist. Growing out of poverty requires that agents invest in buffers to disruptions. These buffers rise and then fall as the economy produces more complex goods, a prediction consistent with global patterns of input inventories. Large jumps in economic complexity can backfire. This result suggests why 'big push' policies can fail and it underscores the importance of reliability and gradual increases in technological complexity. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,"2015592CTH; JSMF","Bonds, M.H.; Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, United States; email: matthew_bonds@hms.harvard.edu","Nature Publishing Group",23973374,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042752837

Management and selection of suppliers and contractors play an important role in the process of constructions since contractors are as corner stones of construction projects. Additionally, contractors are the main factor in converting resources to final products. Traditionally, contractor selection in construction projects is on the basis of the lowest proposed price. However, there are various qualitative and quantitative criteria with different priorities associated in this regard in order to make the best decision. In this paper, a hybrid method of DEA/AHP/FDEMATEL is used. First, important and effective evaluation criteria are selected through an FDEMATEL method. Then, the DEA/AHP method is implemented in order to evaluate and prioritize the selected indicators as well as to incorporate them in a supply chain.

Their operation demands a dedicated communication infrastructure to manage, control and monitor the intermittent sources of energy and loads. Therefore, smart devices will be connected to support the growth of grid smartness increasing the dependency on communication networks, which consumes a high amount of power. In an energy-limited scenario, one of the main issues is to enhance the power supply time. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid methodology for microgrid energy management, integrated with a communication infrastructure to improve and to optimize islanded microgrid operation at maximum energy efficiency. The hybrid methodology applies some control management rules, such as intentional load shedding, priority load management, and communication energy saving. These energy saving rules establish a trade-off between increasing microgrid energy availability and communication system reliability. To achieve a compromised solution, a continuous time Markov chain model describes the impact of energy saving policies into system reliability.

Besides, this study presents the closed-loop network which considers the forward and reverse networks in an integrated manner. In the forward network, this case just considers the forward network, while, the reverse logistic fully focused on the backward network by considering recovering centers (i.e. from recovering centers to remanufacture, recycling and disposal centers). In order to address the problem, ICA, PSO, GA, and also -constraint method, are utilized. In addition, the parameters of algorithms are tuned by Response Surface Method (RSM) with an MODM approach. To explain the efficiency and effectiveness of methods, four assessment metrics are introduced. At the end, the results show the capability of ICA through the most of the tests problem.

SCRM is full of challenges that can result in higher cost, wasted materials and production error. It has become even more complex and vulnerable than in past. Due to absence of commonly recognized definition of SCRM and very scared literature, it is very difficult to clearly understand it. This study has worked on two objectives. First, this study has tried to understand the nature of SCRM by elaborating relevant literature with a novel methodology and to verdict its accurate explanation. Second, compile the diverse and scattered literature so for potential researchers it will be easy to approach it. A comprehensive review shows that study on SCRM is still not only very limited but also much dispersed. This article will elaborate a general literature review on evaluation of definitions of supply chain, risk management and supply chain risk management. This article applies content analysis approach, bibliographic analysis and analyzing top cited journal and researches in SCRM that is a unique and novel methodology. The finding of this study reveals that, majority of the researchers are agreed, risk is variation in outcome or performances that are not predictable, whereas supply chain is a network of organizations that add value in every stage of product or services till its destination toward users. Supply chain risk is probabilistic and unwanted situation whereas supply chain risk management is to manage probabilistic and undesirable situation by evaluating risk sources, analyzing likelihood and present a strategy to avoid, mitigate or minimize the effect of risk sources. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

These supply chains are increasingly exposed to the impacts of a changing climate, yet receive little attention relative to the study of the production phase. Too often, business learns from experience if and how their supply chains can withstand and recover from climate shocks with little insight on proactively developing climate resilient supply chains. We use a network-based simulation approach to estimate the resilience of supply chains, particularly to disruption experienced during climate-related extreme events. We consider supply chain examples from three Australian resource industries – fisheries, agriculture and mining – that have experienced climate shocks in recent years. We derive four supply chain indices – evenness, resilience, continuity of supply and climate resilience – to estimate the performance of simple and complex supply chains in each industry. As with ecological systems, we show that complex supply chains with a large number of nodes and links are more resilient to disruption. Critically, all chains, regardless of their complexity, will have diminished resilience as climate disruptions become more frequent. This highlights the importance of considering the broader economic benefits of diversified chains, leading to risk reduction and improved design post-disruption. It also reinforces the importance of a systems approach to risk management in supply chains, particularly in considering adaptation options for addressing direct and indirect impacts on the chain as well as the global challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate adaptation; Climate change; Disruption; Network modelling; Resilience; Supply chain","adaptive management; climate change; ecosystem resilience; extreme event; global change; global climate; global perspective; network analysis; supply chain management; Australia","CSIRO","Lim-Camacho, L.; CSIRO Land and Water, Pullenvale, Australia; email: lilly.lim-camacho@csiro.au","Elsevier Ltd",09593780,,GECHE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030872691

Applications in content replication in data centers, skillbased routing in call centers, and flexible supply chains are among our main motivations. We focus on the scaling regime where the system size n tends to infinity, while the overall traffic intensity stays fixed. We show that a large capacity region and an asymptotically vanishing queueing delay are simultaneously achievable even under limited flexibility (dn ≪n). Our main results demonstrate that, when dn ≫ln n, a family of expander-graphbased flexibility architectures has a capacity region that is within a constant factor of the maximum possible, while simultaneously ensuring a diminishing queueing delay for all arrival rate vectors in the capacity region. Our analysis is centered around a new class of virtual-queue-based scheduling policies that rely on dynamically constructed job-toserver assignments on the connectivity graph.

Since the uncertainty and risk are often the byproduct of demand variability, growing efforts are made to control demand variability. One of such efforts includes risk pooling which aims to reduce variability by aggregating customer demand across products, time, and location. The success of risk pooling, however, hinges on its ability to consolidate inventory at the central location of a supply chain network. To help supply chain professionals formulate a successful risk pooling strategy, this paper redesigns a warehouse network in such a way that it increases inventory turnover, reduces the risk of inventory obsolescence/shortage/surplus, allocates inventory to field warehouses closer to high demand areas, and centralizes warehouse locations for the aggregated demand. To deal with this complex warehouse network redesign issue, we propose a linearized version of the non-linear, mixed-integer programming model. To validate the usefulness and practicality of the proposed model, it has been applied to an actual supply chain problem facing the Iranian distribution company and then has been tested with ""what-if"" scenarios.","Iranian supply chain management; Location-allocation; Risk pooling strategy; Warehouse network design",,,,"International Forum of Management Scholars",10821910,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030033940

Ehrnsperger KG, Amberger Straße 1, Neumarkt, 92318, Germany","The Federal Government of Germany regards organic farming as particularly resource-efficient and environmentally sustainable economic activity. It therefore supports the expansion of organic farming up to 20% of the agricultural area. Against this background, the German Agricultural Research Alliance (DAFA) together with a broad alliance of representatives from business, science, and public policy developed this research strategy in a theme-finding and prioritization process that ran over more than 2 years. It sets out how German agricultural research can make a substantial contribution to noticeably improving the performance and competitiveness of organic food and farming while at the same time helping the sector meet its own goals and be an example as an especially sustainable type of economic activity in terms of the four international umbrella organization of the organic world (IFOAM) principles of organic farming (health, environment, fairness, and care). The DAFA recommends that three approaches be pursued in parallel: (1) focusing of research on the most important themes, (2) the establishment of efficient structures for research and funding, and (3) more funding for research on organic farming. The following most important research topics in crops were identified: plant breeding tailored to the need of organic agriculture, plant–microbe and plant–plant interactions, autonomous field micro-robots, alternative control of fungal diseases and management of nutrients, and soil fertility. In organic livestock production, the most important topics are to meet competing goals in production systems, to ensure optimum supply of essential amino acids in poultry, and to foster successful animal production by implementing research-practice networks. In addition, progress in the processing of organic foods and the transfer of trustworthiness features as well as reinforcing organic principles in the food chain are needed. It is called for new research and funding structures which are no longer strictly time limited; for research-practice network offering “co-learning” between farmers, advisors, and researchers; for real transdisciplinary funding instruments; for model regions to facilitate transfer of advancement of research and knowledge as well as for federal and state co-funded university chairs. However, these prerequisites for 20% organic agriculture can only be achieved by a parallel increased funding by the governmental authorities. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Agricultural politics; Consumer behavior; IFOAM principles; Organic agriculture; Strategic development",,,"Lange, S.; Johann Heinrich von Thünen Institute, Bundesallee 50, Germany; email: stefan.lange@thuenen.de","Springer Netherlands",18794238,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029514891

Global Industrial Strongest Relevant Network models were established by extracting the strongest and most immediate industrial relevance in the global economic system with inter-country input-output tables and then transformed into Global Industrial Resource Competition Network/Global Industrial Production Collaboration Network models embodying the competitive/collaborative relationships based on bibliographic coupling/co-citation approach. Three indicators well suited for these two kinds of weighted and non-directed networks with self-loops were introduced, including unit weight for competitive/collaborative power, disparity in the weight for competitive/collaborative amplitude and weighted clustering coefficient for competitive/ collaborative intensity. Finally, these models and indicators were further applied to empirically analyze the function of sectors in the latest World Input-Output Database, to reveal inter-sector competitive/collaborative status during the economic globalization. © 2017 Lizhi Xing.

NOLAs are seen as different from traditional labour activist networks in that they are neither solely connected to the position of labour in production processes, nor wholly reliant on the soft and discursive power of advocacy coalitions. The authors understand NOLAs to be characterized by the interaction of different types of labour rights, social movement and community organizations, joining forces in complex forms of strategizing vis-à-vis multiple targets. Thus, cross-boundary strategizing (across organizational and geographical divides) is seen as a basic characteristic of NOLAs. The authors argue that NOLAs continue to be deeply embedded in political-economic contexts of the state and global value chains, and alliance formation reflects the peculiar vulnerabilities and constraints resulting from this embeddedness. This Introduction draws on multiple studies of NOLAs from around the world, but its main focus is on some of those Asian countries which are at the centre of global supply chain capitalism and labour exploitation, and which have become the laboratory for new forms of networked worker agency and activism. © 2017 International Institute of Social Studies",,"advocacy; capitalism; collective action; community organization; labor productivity; social movement; supply chain management; trade union","DFG; ","Zajak, S.; Institute for Social Movements, Germany; email: sabrina.zajak@rub.de","Blackwell Publishing Ltd",0012155X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028752603

In particular, we study a Reverse Supply Chain Network Design (RSCND), which is designed according to three fundamental echelons (i.e. waste collection, processing and customer zones). To this end, the simultaneous application of simulation techniques and optimization algorithms is proposed. Both approaches are framed within a general methodology, which has been taken from the Operations Research literature. We present a case study from a Colombian city. The combined algorithmic approaches, which include discrete simulation and multiobjective optimization, provide sufficient evidence regarding ways to optimally manage fleet size in the RSCND.

New employment opportunities, however, have been under-pinned by poverty wages and inhumane working conditions as states ‘race to the bottom’ in terms of labour rights and regulations in order to be competitive and attract capital investment. Labour agency at the bottom of transnational supply chains is often said to be structurally powerless because of the international mobility of capital. The ‘boomerang effect’ has often been presented as a remedy that increases local bargaining power in the global South by mobilizing consumer pressure in the global North through multi-stakeholder initiatives or transnational advocacy networks. The problem with this perspective is that it overstates the Northern dimension of this transnational politics and underestimates the local power base of Southern trade unions and labour movements. The incipient debate about Networks of Labour Activism (NOLA) aims to overcome this Northern bias.

Some commentators argue that the Accord is a ‘game changer’ in times of corporate social responsibility (CSR), especially because it includes transnational buying companies in a legally binding contract with union federations. This article takes the Accord as an interesting case for how labour networks become part of a transnational governance arrangement. Taking a cultural political economy perspective, the author assumes that the Accord marks a practice of implementing ethical demands under conditions of supply chain capitalism and argues that calling the Accord a paradigm shift would be overly optimistic: while labour networks were able to use a crisis in the regime of CSR policies, they could not challenge the managerial culture of translating political demands according to the conventions of supply chain management. These conventions separate the sources of profit from the political claim for decent labour standards. In a transnational governance initiative, labour networks rely on such management conventions, since they are constitutive of the production network. From this perspective the Accord is an impressive reaction to the Rana Plaza disaster, but not a game changer. © 2017 International Institute of Social Studies","Capitalism; Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR); Cultural; Governance; Labour; Southern Asia; Transnational","capitalism; corporate social responsibility; cultural economy; governance approach; labor standard; labor supply; political economy; supply chain management; Bangladesh",,"Scheper, C.; Institute for Development and Peace, Germany; email: cscheper@inef.uni-due.de","Blackwell Publishing Ltd",0012155X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026348711

Each with the odds of a 100-year occurrence suggesting that such extreme events are the region's “new normal.” City and state policy-makers, in response, are studying how to develop a network of robust, resilient critical infrastructure facilities. These studies, however, typically fail to address interdependencies among critical infrastructures and lack a quantitative tool to investigate the maximum resilience possessed by a given infrastructure facility in the face of climate-change-induced hazards. We propose a multi-stage stochastic mathematical program to maximize network resilience given: i) random arrival of extreme events; ii) the network's inherent capacity to withstand and cope with the aftermath of exogenous shocks; iii) pre-, during-, and post-event strategies available to enhance system operability; and iv) budgeting and technological restrictions facing policy-makers. Our approach allows both qualitative and quantitative paradigms to interact. Our model thus clarifies how to allocate resources proactively and how the network's absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capacities can be coordinated to enhance overall system resilience.

Each node follows a base-stock policy and a first-come, first-served allocation policy. We develop two heuristics, the recursive optimization (RO) heuristic and the decomposition-aggregation (DA) heuristic, to approximate the optimal base-stock levels of all the locations in the system. The RO heuristic applies a bottom-up approach that sequentially solves single-variable, convex problems for each location. The DA heuristic decomposes the distribution system into multiple serial systems, solves for the base-stock levels of these systems using the newsvendor heuristic of Shang and Song (2003), and then aggregates the serial systems back into the distribution system using a procedure we call “backorder matching.” A key advantage of the DA heuristic is that it does not require any evaluation of the cost function (a computationally costly operation that requires numerical convolution). We show that, for both RO and DA, changing some of the parameters, such as leadtime, unit backordering cost, and demand rate, of a location has an impact only on its own local base-stock level and its upstream locations’ local base-stock levels. An extensive numerical study shows that both heuristics perform well, with the RO heuristic providing more accurate results and the DA heuristic consuming less computation time. We show that both RO and DA are asymptotically optimal along multiple dimensions for two-echelon distribution systems. Finally, we show that, with minor changes, both RO and DA are applicable to the balanced allocation policy. © 2017 Production and Operations Management Society","asymptotic analysis; distribution network; heuristics; inventory; multi-echelon supply chain",,"NSF: CMMI-0726822; NSFC: 71202068, 71421002, 71522009, 71632007",,"Wiley-Blackwell",10591478,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020382074

Such behavior exists in biological systems, physical systems as well as in the human performance. It is an inherited nature of a System-of-Systems (SoS). A suitable framework is needed to guide the development of SoS architecture, which includes emergent behavior. Enterprise architecture (EA) is a discipline driving change within organizations. Aligning and integrating business and IT thereby belongs to strategic management. The management of EA change is a challenging task for enterprise architects, due to complex dependencies amongst EA models, when evolving towards different alternatives. In this paper, various architecture frameworks are explored for an application on SoS architecture: the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) and Ministry of Defense Architecture Framework (MODAF) are declared inappropriate. The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF), the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF) and the Zachman Framework on the other hand are suitable. The use of Zachman Framework to guide the architecture development is described in step-by-step details in this paper. The agent-based simulation is recommended to develop the SoS architectural models following the Zachman Framework guidance. Ultimately, SysML and UML should be integrated with the agent-based model.

To further develop such transitional ambitions, WM organizations are increasingly looking toward inter-organizational resource network concepts (such as the circular economy and industrial symbiosis) as models of how they would like to create new value together with their customers and partners. This article aims to take a step in addressing uncertainties behind such transitions by analyzing barriers for inter-organizational resource management and in turn uncovering some potential opportunities and risks of novel offerings from the WM sector. Obstacles for developing innovative inter-organizational resource networks have been identified based on studies of implementing industrial symbiosis networks. Subsequently, managing executives from Swedish private and public WM organizations were interviewed regarding the sector's capacity to overcome such barriers – opportunities and risks of providing new resource management services – and how their organizations might approach the role of actively facilitating more resource efficient regions. Eco-Industrial park management and contracting out holistic resource management are some areas in which the respondents see WM organizations offering new services. In relation to such approaches, various risks (e.g. being cut out of investment benefits, or unstable supply) and opportunities (e.g. new markets and enhanced sustainability profiles) were identified. Additionally, it was seen that WM companies would need to make substantial changes to their business approach, becoming less dependent on flows of mixed materials for example, if they are to become even more central value chain actors. To strengthen such approaches, it was seen that the sector will need to find methods to strategically build strong, long term partnerships, expand upon and take advantage of available knowledge resources (i.e. best practice technologies and regional material flows), and explore new business models (i.e. stockpiling, park management, or waste minimization). Additionally, working with sector representatives to argue for a more balanced market conditions next to primary production should assist the viability of new offerings in the wider market. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Business development; Circular economy; Green innovation; Industrial symbiosis; Recycling",,,"Aid, G.; Ragn-Sells AB.

Considering the concern with regard to food quality assurance and consumer confidence improvement, many companies have developed a traceability system to visualize the supply chain and avoid food safety incidents. In this paper, we proposed an improved food traceability system which can not only achieve forward tracking and diverse tracing like the existing systems do, but also evaluate the food quality timely along the supply chain and provide consumers with these evaluating information, to mainly enhance the consumer experience and help firms gain the trust of consumers. For the food quality evaluation, the method of fuzzy classification was used to evaluate the food quality at each stages of supply chain while the artificial neural network was adopted to derive the final determination of the grade of food quality according to all the stage quality evaluations. A case study of a pork producer was conducted, and the results showed that the improved traceability system performed well in food quality assurance and evaluation.

They support chemical safety assessments under the European Union (EU) regulation Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals. SPERCs have been developed by industry and subjected to regulatory review. Within the framework of the Chemical Safety Report/Exposure Scenario Roadmap, the EU Chemicals Agency (ECHA), the EU Member State authorities, and European industry sector associations collaborate to improve the quality of the SPERCs. Following up on the outcome of ECHA's SPERC Best Practice Project, industry, together with ECHA, developed an updated SPERC factsheet template and guidance on how to fill it out. In addition, industry developed 2 sets of SPERC factsheet examples and the corresponding SPERC background documents. These documents were submitted to a multistakeholder review process. The comments from the review were discussed at a workshop in spring 2016. The workshop participants acknowledged the revised factsheet format including the corresponding guidance, the 2 SPERC factsheets, and the 2 SPERC background documents as best practice examples. The package is expected to support further improvement of the quality of the SPERCs. A common understanding was achieved of the need to match the level of detail of the use conditions description with the risk to be controlled (i.e., the emission intensity and hazard profile of the substances) and with the level of conservatism of SPERC release factors. The complete and transparent documentation of the derivation of the release factors and of their conservatism is conceived as crucial for the credibility of the SPERCs, such that they can be trusted by partners in the chemicals supply chain and by regulators. To that end, background documents will include a dedicated section describing the conservatism of SPERCs. The workshop concluded with an outline of the practical way forward for the improvement of SPERC documentation. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2017;13:815–820. © 2017 The Authors.

This paper maximizes the total profit over a three-tiered distribution system consisting of plants, distribution centers (DCs) and customers. Plants produce multiple products that are shipped to DCs. If a DC is used, then a fixed cost (FC) is charged. The customers are supplied by a single DC. To characterize the uncertainty in the practical decision environment, this paper considers the unit cost of TP, FC, the supply capacities and demands as Gaussian type-2 fuzzy variables. To give a modeling framework for optimization problems with multifold uncertainty, different reduction methods were proposed to transform a Gaussian type-2 fuzzy variable into a type-1 fuzzy variable by mean reduction method and CV reduction method. Then, the TP was reformulated as a chance-constrained programming model enlightened by the credibility optimization methods. The deterministic models are then solved using two different soft computing techniques—generalized reduced gradient and modified particle swarm optimization, where the position of each particle is adjusted according to its own experience and that of its neighbors. The numerical experiments illustrated the application and effectiveness of the proposed approaches. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Gaussian type-2 fuzzy variables; Mean and CV reduction methods; Particle swarm optimization; Supply chain; Transportation problem","Computer programming; Gaussian distribution; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Profitability; Soft computing; Supply chains; Transportation; Uncertainty analysis; Chance-constrained programming model; Generalized reduced gradient; Modified particle swarm optimization; Reduction method; Softcomputing techniques; Supply chain optimization; Transportation problem; Type-2 fuzzy variables; Constrained optimization",,"Jana, D.K.; Department of Applied Science, India; email: dipakjana@gmail.com","Springer London",09410643,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957591063

The platform is called NIMBLE and is currently being developed in a European research project. The presented approach utilizes microservice technology, and implements the core business functionality of the platform through a composition of decentralized, scalable services. The communication among services, and with platform users, manufacturers, suppliers, sensors and Web resources, is supported through simple protocols and lightweight mechanisms. Core business services of the implemented architecture are released as open source software, enabling multiple prospective platform-providers to establish B2B marketplaces for collaboration within their own industrial sector or region. To demonstrate microservices in practice, we present two scenarios, both related to manufacturing of wooden home buildings: one is IoT-based data sharing in a supply chain, and the other deals with product driven logistics planning. The further development of the platform will be driven by the requirements of at least four different use cases throughout Europe, and by incorporating advanced business models to support the growth of powerful network effects of the platform. © 2017 IEEE.","cloud; federation; Industry 4.0; IoT; IoT-based supply chain; microservice; platform","Clouds; Distributed computer systems; Manufacture; Open source software; Open systems; Software engineering; Supply chains; Architectural approach; Collaborative platform; European research project; federation; Implemented architectures; microservice; platform; Real time monitoring; Internet of things","H2020: 723810; EC",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509058730,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029315729

To support these diverse functions, mitochondria form an extensive network with smaller clusters that are able to move along microtubules aided by motor proteins. Mitochondria are also associated with the actin network, which is involved in cellular responses to various mechanical factors. In this review, we discuss mitochondrial structure and function in relation to the cytoskeleton and various mechanical factors influencing cell functions. We first summarize the morphological features of mitochondria with an emphasis on fission and fusion as well as how network properties govern function. We then review the relationship between the mitochondria and the cytoskeletal structures, including mechanical interactions. We also discuss how stretch and its dynamic pattern affect mitochondrial structure and function. Finally, we present preliminary data on how extracellular matrix stiffness influences mitochondrial morphology and ATP generation. We conclude by discussing the more general role that mitochondria may play in mechanobiology and how the mechanosensitivity of mitochondria may contribute to the development of several diseases and aging. © 2017 by the authors.

Also, research methods are explicated; the scale-free networks and the theory of strong ties are integrated; the features of supply chain networks are considered from single statistical parameters and comprehensive analyses. Next, we provide numeric simulation of the properties of supply chain networks, verifying the accuracy of parameter analyses of single statistics and comprehensive analyses. Ultimately, when coping with supply chain disruption risk, each node enterprise of supply chain network is supposed to deploy the characteristics of scale-free networks to systematically manage existing weak ties, weak ties newly introduced, existing strong ties and strong ties newly introduced.

Finally, the proposed electrical configuration arises as a suitable grid interconnection solution, as it not only provides maximum power supply from the wave energy resource, but it also contributes towards further reducing its output power oscillations. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.",,"Chemical equipment; Controllers; Electric power system control; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conversion; Energy resources; Power converters; Vector control (Electric machinery); Wave power; Electrical configurations; Energy extraction; Grid interconnections; Irregular waves; Maximum power; Primary resources; Wave energy converters; Wave energy resources; Wave energy conversion",,"Cantarellas, A.; Abengoa Research, Campus Palmas Altas, Spain; email: antoni.mir@abengoa.com","Institution of Engineering and Technology",17554535,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026729441

An analysis based on the co-occurrence of title words allows identifying dominant sub-themes and their evolution. Main results point to the gradual diversification of container shipping research, from the dominance of economics towards a more trans-disciplinary set of approaches which integrate port-related activities and multimodal networks. Yet, disciplinary specialization remains strong up to nowadays so that container shipping research remains rather fragmented. While co-authorships have increased over time, they remain polarized by few, weakly connected research battalions.

The plethora of BIM-based technologies affects both inter- and intra-organizational relations. Structured inter-organizational networks across tiers, such as supply chain (SC) partnerships were used to examine how BIM affects these changing relations across and within firms’ boundaries. Empirical explorations around the interplay between BIM and SC partnering–as a proxy for supply chain management (SCM) philosophy–were deployed to assess their contribution to SC integration, and to investigate the functions of key actors in AEC. One young and one long-standing SC partnership were studied, and it was observed that the contractual arrangements had to be complemented by well-defined BIM scope, and communications across multiple tiers to built trust and support collaboration in the network. There were two types of BIM-enabled SC partnering: with emphasis on either transactions or relations, the former being merely operational whereas the latter strategic. These inter-organizational orientations of BIM-enabled SC partnering outlined further intra-organizational conditions for integration regarding functional division, business models and services offered. The study carries implications for BIM and SCM researchers, policy-makers and practitioners, and proposes strategies for SC integration by aligning intra- with inter-organizational relations. © 2017 The Author(s).

Later on, monitoring services became one of the major interests, including sensing technologies, and then more actuation for remote control-type of IoT applications such as smart homes, smart cities and Industry 4.0. In this paper, the authors focus on the RFID technology impairment. They propose to take advantage of the mature IoT technologies that offer native service discovery such as blutooth or LTE D2D ProSe or Wifi Direct. Using the automatic service discovery in the new framework will make heterogeneous readers aware of the presence of other readers and this will be used by the proposed distributed algorithm to better control the multiple RFID reader interference problem. The author clearly considers emerging Industry 4.0 use case, where RFID technology is of major interest for both identification and tracking. To enhance the RFID tag reading performance, collisions in the RFID frequency should be minimized with reader-to-reader coordination protocols. In this paper, the author proposes a simple distributed reader anti-collision protocol named DiSim that makes use of proximity services of IoT network and is compliant with the current RFID standards. The author evaluates the efficiency of the proposal via simulation. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the author proposes a simple distributed reader anti-collision protocol named DiSim that makes use of proximity services of IoT network and is compliant with the current RFID standards. The author evaluates the efficiency of the proposal via simulation to study its behavior in very dense and heterogeneous RFID environments. Specifically, the author explores the coexistence of powerful static readers and small mobile readers, comparing the proposal with a standard ETSI CSMA method. The proposal reduces significantly the number of access attempts, which are resource-expensive for the readers. The results show that the objectives of DiSim are met, producing low reader collision probability and, however, having lower average readings per reader per time. Findings: DiSim is evaluated with the ETSI standard LBT protocol for multi-reader environments in several environments with varied levels of reader and tag densities, having both static powerful RFID readers and heterogeneous randomly moving mobile RFID readers. It effectively reduces the number of backoffs or contentions for the RFID channel. This has high reading success rate due to the avoided collisions; however, the readers are put to wait, and DiSim has less average readings per reader per time. As an additional side evaluation, the ETSI standard LBT mechanism was found to present a good performance for low-density mid-coverage scenarios, however, with high variability on the evaluation results. Research limitations/implications: To show more results, the author needs to do real experimentation in a warehouse, such as Amazon warehouse, where he expects to have more and more robots, start shelves, automatic item finding on the shelve, etc. Practical implications: Future work considers experimentation in a real warehouse equipped with heterogeneous RFID readers and real-time analysis of RFID reading efficiency also combined with indoor localization and navigation for warehouse mobile robots. Social implications: More automatization is expected in the future; this work makes the use of RFID technology more efficient and opens more possibilities for services deployment in different domains such as the industry which was considered not only in this paper but also in smart cites and smart homes. Originality/value: Compared to the literature, the proposal offers the advantage to not be dependent on a centralized server controlling the RFID readers. It also offers the possibility for an existing RFID architecture to add new readers from a different manufacturer, as the readers using the approach will have the possibility to discover the capabilities of the new interaction other RFID readers. This solution takes advantage of the available proximity service that will be more and more offered by the IoT technologies. © 2017, Jose Ignacio Tamayo Segarra, Bilal Al Jammal and Hakima Chaouchi.","Device to device; Internet of Things; Proximity service; RFID reader-to-reader collision; RFID technology; Supply chain efficiency",,,"Chaouchi, H.; Telecom Sud Paris, France; email: hakima.chaouchi@telecom-sudparis.eu","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",23991747,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060894452

In ischemic stroke (∼87% of all strokes) and transient ischemic attack (TIA), the blood vessel carrying blood to the brain is blocked causing deficit in the glucose supply - the main energy source. Here, neurovascular coupling (NVC) mechanism links neural activity with the corresponding blood flow that supplies glucose and oxygen for neuronal energy. Brain accounts for about 25% of total glucose consumption while being 2% of the total body weight. Therefore, a deficit in glucose supply can quickly change brain's energy supply chain that can be transient (in TIA) or longer lasting (in stroke, vascular dementia). Here, implications of the failure of brain's energy supply chain can be dysfunctional brain networks in cerebrovascular diseases. Using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in conjunction with electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive, real-time and point of care method to monitor the neuroenergetic status of the cortical gray matter is proposed. Furthermore, we propose that NIRS-EEG joint-imaging can be used to dose non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) - transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and photobiomodulation - which may be able to provide therapeutic options for patients with energetic insufficiency by modulating the cortical neural activity and hemodynamics. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Blood vessels; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Energy resources; Glucose; Hemodynamics; Infrared devices; Near infrared spectroscopy; Neurons; Supply chains; Central nervous systems; Cerebrovascular disease; Closed-loop control; Energy supply chains; Neuro-vascular coupling; Neurological deficit; Non-invasive brain stimulations; Transient ischemic attacks; Brain",,,"IEEE Computer Society",19483546,9781538619162,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028619555

The empirical investigation is conducted using an innovative archive containing detailed information on a large share of Italian micro and small firms that are generally excluded from most firm-level databases. The results show that, inside industrial districts, subcontractors are best described as a set of heterogeneous agents with distinct identities and idiosyncratic approaches to the market. The most widely diffused type of supplier still retains most of the structural characteristics traditionally described by the literature. However, industrial districts are also characterized by the presence of advanced forms of subcontractors whose organizational structure differs from that of a traditional supplier: in fact, such producers share more commonalities with end product firms. The analysis of the performances indicates that advanced subcontractors displayed better results during the period 2008–2012, while traditional suppliers tend to occupy a peripheral position in most subcontracting networks. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","global value chain; industrial districts; outsourcing; Subcontracting; suppliers","empirical analysis; financial crisis; heterogeneity; industrial district; outsourcing; supply chain management; Italy",,"Canello, J.; Department of Geography and Earth Sciences, United States; email: jcanello@uncc.edu","Routledge",08985626,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026402286

To test this hypothesis, we determined bacterial community composition in the water column and sediment of headwater streams located across a gradient of watershed impervious cover using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Alpha diversity metrics did not show a strong response to catchment urbanization, but beta diversity was significantly related to watershed impervious cover with significant differences also found between water column and sediment samples. Samples grouped primarily according to habitat-water column vs. sediment-with a significant response to watershed impervious cover nested within each habitat type. Compositional shifts for communities in urbanized streams indicated an increase in taxa associated with human activity including bacteria from the genus Polynucleobacter, which is widespread, but has been associated with eutrophic conditions in larger water bodies. Another indicator of communities in urbanized streams was an OTU from the genus Gallionella, which is linked to corrosion of water distribution systems. To identify changes in bacterial community interactions, bacterial co-occurrence networks were generated from urban and forested samples. The urbanized co-occurrence network was much smaller and had fewer co-occurrence events per taxon than forested equivalents, indicating a loss of keystone taxa with urbanization. Our results suggest that urbanization has significant impacts on the community composition of headwater streams, and suggest that processes driving these changes in urbanized water column vs. sediment environments are distinct. © 2017 Hosen, Febria, Crump and Palmer.","16S rRNA gene; Bacteria; Community ecology; Streams; Urbanization; Watersheds","dissolved organic matter; dissolved oxygen; RNA 16S; amplicon; Article; environmental factor; Gallionella; gene sequence; Hyphomicrobium; landscape ecology; microbial community; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; Polynucleobacter; Proteobacteria; sediment; species composition; species diversity; species richness; stream (river); taxonomic identification; urbanization; water supply; water temperature; watershed","NSF: 0424602, 1052875, 1147378, 1210516, DEB-1210516; EPA: DEB-1147378, GS-10F-0502N, OCE-0424602; NOAA: NA10OAR431220; UMD; SESYNC: DBI-1052875","Hosen, J.D.; Chesapeake Biological LaboratoryUnited States; email: jhosen@umd.edu","Frontiers Media S.A.",1664302X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026788686

Most of the models developed to optimize biomass supply chains have failed to quantify the effect of biomass quality and preprocessing operations required to meet biomass specifications on overall cost and performance. The Integrated Biomass Supply Analysis and Logistics (IBSAL) model estimates the harvesting, collection, transportation, and storage cost while considering the stochastic behavior of the field-to-biorefinery supply chain. This paper proposes an IBSAL-SimMOpt (Simulation-based Multi-Objective Optimization) method for optimizing the biomass quality and costs associated with the efforts needed to meet conversion technology specifications. The method is developed in two phases. For the first phase, a SimMOpt tool that interacts with the extended IBSAL is developed. For the second phase, the baseline IBSAL model is extended so that the cost for meeting and/or penalization for failing in meeting specifications are considered. The IBSAL-SimMOpt method is designed to optimize quality characteristics of biomass, cost related to activities intended to improve the quality of feedstock, and the penalization cost. A case study based on 1916 farms in Ontario, Canada is considered for testing the proposed method. Analysis of the results demonstrates that this method is able to find a high-quality set of non-dominated solutions. © 2017 by the authors.","Bioenergy; Biofuels; Biomass; Discrete-event simulation; Logistics; Optimization; Renewable energy; Simulation-based optimization; Supply chain network design","Biofuels; Biomass; Costs; Discrete event simulation; Feedstocks; Logistics; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Quality control; Specifications; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Bio-energy; Nondominated solutions; Physical characteristics; Pre-processing operations; Quality characteristic; Renewable energies; Simulation-based optimizations; Supply chain network design; Cost benefit analysis","2015-38422-24064; USDOE: 4000142556; USDA: 2014-38502-22598, 2568930, 3TC460; NIFA; CONACYT","Castillo-Villar, K.K.; Mechanical Engineering Department, One UTSA Circle, United States; email: Krystel.Castillo@utsa.edu","MDPI AG",19961073,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044437039

Responsiveness and reliability are important social responsibility measures for consumers and all stakeholders that strategists and company managers should be concerned about them in long-term planning horizon. Although, presence of uncertainties as an intrinsic part of supply chains could adversely affect the best set plans by field experts. Accordingly, uncertainty of parameters and uncertainties caused by disruptions should be regarded in planning process of networks to prevent unpredictable negative consequences of such uncertainties for all echelons of supply chain. Based on enumerated matters, the aim of this paper is to design a reliable multi-echelon closed loop supply chain network model that maximizes social responsibility while minimizing fixed establishing and variable processing costs of network design. To cope with uncertainty of parameters, stochastic programming is applied and an effective reliable modelling method is employed to appropriately control unpleasant economic impacts of disruptions. Notably, an efficient robust programming method is applied to give the decision makers the capability to control level of risk-averseness of decisions while modelling uncertain parameters. Finally, the proposed model is solved and its outputs are analyzed on the basis of generated test problems which shows correct performance and applicability of extended model in real world problems.","Reliability; Robustness; Social Responsibility; Stochastic Programming; Supply Chain","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Reliability; Risk assessment; Robustness (control systems); Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain networks; Long-term planning horizon; Processing costs; Real-world problem; Reverse supply chains; Robust programming; Social responsibilities; Uncertain parameters; Uncertainty analysis",,"Hamidieh, A.; Industrial Engineering Group, Iran; email: hamidieh@tpnu.ac.ir","Materials and Energy Research Center",1728144X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036453964

The supply of RM is not only a matter of availability of primary but also of secondary raw materials (SRM). In fact a great amount of waste can be regained as practical and valuable SRM by enhancing the recovery processes from industrial, mining and municipal landfill sites, especially if we consider that Europe is highly dependent on the imports of several RM. Nevertheless, there is to date no inventory of SRM at EU level. Smart Ground project aims to facilitate the availability and accessibility of data and information on SRM in the EU, as well as creating synergy and collaboration between the different stakeholders involved in the SRM value chain. In order to do so, the Smart Ground consortium is carrying out a set of activities to integrate in a single EU database all the data from existing sources and new information retrieving pilot landfills as progress is made. Such database will enable the exchange of contacts and information among the relevant stakeholders, interested in providing or obtaining SRM. Finally, Smart Ground project will also spin out the SRM economy and employment thanks to targeted training activities, organized during congresses and dedicated meeting with stakeholders and end users interested in calculating the potentiality for SRM recovery from selected landfills, contemporary constituting a dedicated network of stakeholders committed to cost-effective research, technology transfer and training. © 2017, Gh.

GPN provides great opportunities for developing countries to blend in global economy and realize their technological advance, as well as value chain upgrading. Facing the pressure of shifting model of economic development, China has urgent need of optimizing export trade though she has experienced marvelous success especially on export trade during the past few decades, so that the study on export product upgrading can be particularly important. Based on such consideration, this article focuses on how participating GPN influences China's export product upgrade. This article uses the conception of quality to quantitively describe product upgrade, and we calculate the product quality based on data of customs trade database from 2000 to 2011. The result shows that export product quality presents a declining trend from east to west of China, and the average quality of the whole country fluctuates a lot during 2000- 2011 with a slight rising trend showing up recently. We then build several econometric models to examine whether participating in GPN matters, and how exactly this influence works. The results show that participating in GPN has remarkable influence on export product upgrading especially in eastern China, but market dispersion does not help in product upgrading. We also find that R&D investment cannot promote regional position in global value chain in eastern China, forming a typical ""Low-end lock-in"". Capitaland technology- intensive products benefit a lot from participating in GPN while labourintensive exports may open markets with low-quality products. Fiscal decentralization is a key determinant in eastern and central provinces, and local governments tend to give more support to technology-intensive product upgrading. © 2017, Science Press.

This suggests a potential for emissions reductions through improved accessibility to efficient technologies. This paper estimates an upper-bound CO2 emission mitigation potential that could theoretically be achieved by improved access to efficient technologies in industrial sectors. We develop a linear optimization framework that facilitates the exchange of sectoral production technologies based on the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), assuming perfect substitutability of technologies and homogeneity within economic sectors, while ignoring barriers to technological adoption and price driven adjustments. We consider the full global supply chain network and multiple upstream production inputs in addition to energy demand. In contrast to existing literature our framework allows to consider supply chain effects of technology replacements. We use our model to calculate emission reduction potentials for varying levels of access to technology. If best practice technologies were made available globally, CO2 emissions could theoretically be reduced by more than 10 gigatons (Gt). In fact, even second-tier production technologies would create significant global reduction potentials. We decompose sectoral emission reductions to identify contributions by changes in energy intensity, supply chain effects and changes in carbon intensities. Excluding the latter, we find that considering supply chain effects increases total mitigation potentials by 14%. The largest CO2 emission reduction potentials are found for a small set of developing countries. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","GHG mitigation potential; Multi-regional input output data; Multiple production inputs; Optimization; Sectoral energy intensities; Supply chain effects; Technology transfer","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Developing countries; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Industrial emissions; Linear programming; Optimization; Supply chains; Technology transfer; CO2 emission reduction; Emission reduction potentials; GHG mitigation; Global supply chain network; Input-output data; Multiple production inputs; Sectoral energy; Technological adoption; Greenhouse gases; carbon emission; developing world; emission control; greenhouse gas; input-output analysis; optimization; supply chain management; technology adoption; technology transfer","DFG; ","Ward, H.; Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change, Torgauer Staße 12−15, Germany; email: ward@mcc-berlin.net","Elsevier B.V.",09287655,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030702075

The scientists believe that if environmental degradation continues at its current pace, the prospect of human life will be shrouded in mystery. One of the most effective ways to deal with the environmental adverse effects is by implementing green supply chains. In this study a multilevel mathematical model including supply, production, distribution and customer levels has been presented for routing-location-inventory in green supply chain. Vehicle routing between distribution centres and customers has been considered in the model. Establishment place of distribution centres among potential places is determined by the model. The distributors use continuous review policy (r, Q) to control the inventory. The proposed model object is to find an optimal supply chain with minimum costs. To validate the proposed model and measure its compliance with real world problems, GAMS IDE/ Cplex has been used. In order to measure the efficiency of the proposed model in large scale problems, a genetic algorithm has been used. The results confirm the efficiency of the proposed model as a practical tool for decision makers to solve location-inventory-routing problems in green supply chain.

We start by identifying requirements for such reference datasets, and then we identify the main building blocks. The nodes of the supply chain that represent semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities (wafer fabs) are built on a simulation model from the measurement and improvement of manufacturing capacity project. We present two techniques to reduce the modeling and computational burden that are able to deal with load-dependent cycle times in single front-end and back-end facilities and in the overall network. The first method models in detail only the bottlenecks in the nodes of the supply chain, while the second one uses empirical distributions for cycle time and throughput. The quality of these reduction techniques is assessed by comparing the detailed model and the models with a reduced level of detail. We present an application scenario for the testbed by simulating a semiconductor supply network.

However, this traditional linear concept of an SC is egotistic and oversimplified and does not sufficiently reflect the complex and cyclical structure of supplier-customer relationships in current economic and industrial situations. The interactional relationships and topological characteristics between suppliers and customers should be analyzed using supply networks (SNs) rather than traditional linear SCs. Therefore, this paper reconceptualizes SCs as SNs in complex adaptive systems (CAS), and presents three main contributions. First, we propose an integrated framework of CAS network by synthesizing multi-level network analysis from the network-, community- and vertex-perspective. The CAS perspective enables us to understand the advances of SN properties. Second, in order to emphasize the CAS properties of SNs, we conducted a real-world SN based on the Japanese industry and describe an advanced investigation of SN theory. The CAS properties help in enriching the SN theory, which can benefit SN management, community economics and industrial resilience. Third, we propose a quantitative metric of entropy to measure the complexity and robustness of SNs. The results not only support a specific understanding of the structural outcomes relevant to SNs, but also deliver efficient and effective support to the management and design of SNs. © 2017 by the authors.","Complex adaptive systems (CAS); Entropy; Network analysis; Network clustering; Network complexity; Network robustness; Participation coefficient; Scenario analysis; Supply chain (SC); Supply network (SN)",,"JSPS: 16H02034","Zuo, Y.; Institutes of Innovation for Future Society, Japan; email: zuo@nagoya-u.jp","MDPI AG",10994300,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028499655

By combining within-node dynamics of stocks with stochastic jumps describing animal exchanges between nodes, our model reproduces the dynamical network of animal trade between holdings. Variants of the model, either closely calibrated on the data, or based on mechanistic economical assumptions, are considered. In addition to mathematical investigation of the average dynamical behaviour, model performances are assessed on three datasets (including or not intermediary trade operators such as marketplaces and assembly centres), covering 5 years of cattle movement in the département of Finistére (France), as a case study. Model outputs are compared with data regarding the average size of traded batches per holding and the length of temporal trade chains with the potential to transmit disease across the market. We observe an overall good agreement with the data, with variations between models, depending on the criteria (aggregated or time-varying) and datasets considered. These findings highlight the impact of highvolume nodes such as markets and assembly centres on trade flows, as well as the importance of correctly reproducing temporal features of dynamical trade networks. Our study represents one of the first attempts of building dynamical models of livestock trade networks, incorporating simple economic mechanisms, proving to be useful for analysing and predicting cattle trade movements. Future work in this direction might lead to a more detailed analysis of the subnetworks (e.g. beef, dairy) of this complex market, as well as a better understanding of the economic drivers underlying cattle movement, allowing the improvement of predictions of its temporal features, especially in the context of outbreaks. © The authors 2016.

The porous substrate enables capillary condensation of volatiles leading to a change in effective dielectric constant of the substrate which in turn shifts the resonance frequency. The designed sensor has multiple reuse capability and is applicable for continuous monitoring of volatiles such as methanol, iso-propyl alcohol, acetone and n-octane. The proposed sensor can wirelessly detect a 0.15 cc volume of volatiles in air making it highly sensitive.

The Backbone of this technology is the reconstitution of an artificial wafer or substrate with known good dies. This characteristic is an enabler to develop much larger substrate sizes beyond 300mm to take advantage of economies of scale in the packaging manufacturing processes. Substrate sizes larger than 500mm are currently under detailed evaluation for setup of the initial pilot manufacturing lines. However, the processing of large scale substrates at high yield and low cost is a tremendous challenge for the semiconductor packaging industry and its supply chain. In addition, increasing technical requirements like L/S resolution down to 2μm, the formation of high aspect ratio features like tall Cu pillars up to 200μm, and high plating uniformity on large areas place extreme high demands on materials and processing techniques. A new panel based plating technology suite for substrates up to 510x515mm will be discussed in detail and latest technical achievements will be demonstrated. The combination of new electrolytes that enable high speed conformal Cu deposition with an adapted plating equipment technology will be discussed in detail, including reliability data, within die and within panel uniformity test data for different features including Cu pads and redistribution layer (RDL) structures.

FOWLP is becoming increasingly significant and is projected to drive growth in advanced packaging for the foreseeable future. There are many different processing technologies for fabricating FOWLP. One common key practice, which is very different from fan-in wafer level packaging, is the use of a temporary carrier to support wafer-level fabrication. The redistribution-layer (RDL) first approach is one of two mainstream processing technologies for FOWLP at present. One benefit is that the RDL is fabricated with direct support of a flat, rigid carrier prior to the occurrence of molding warpage and die shift. However, the RDL-first approach requires a carrier sacrificial layer that can withstand high-temperature/high-vacuum RDL build-up fabrication. Determined by adhesive chemistry's availability, the present forms of RDL-first FOWLP processing require carrier release by laser ablation, thus further limiting the choice of carrier to glass. At present, laser debonding for RDL-first FOWLP is a very costly and lengthy process. This paper presents a design for optimizing and processing a carrier-sacrificial layer that is compatible not only with current RDL-first FOWLP fabrication, but also enables the carrier's instant release by air jetting at room temperature. This air-assisted mechanical release of the carrier minimizes debonding stress on the wafer surface without localized heating and burning, and provides even more stress relief for larger carriers. A fan-out WLP process flow with air jetting carrier release is presented and evaluated. Key material properties of the current sacrificial-layer design are also analyzed. © 2017 IEEE.","Air Jetting; Debonding; FOWLP; Low Stress; Low Warpage; RDL-First; Temporary Support","Ablation; Debonding; Fabrication; Integrated circuit design; Laser ablation; Network components; Packaging; Stress relief; Stresses; Supply chain management; FOWLP; Low stress; RDL-First; Temporary support; Warpages; Electronics packaging",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",05695503,9781509043323,PECCA,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028039552

These networks are increasingly used to inform strategies to prevent and control the spread of hospital-associated pathogens. However, many studies only consider patients that are received directly from the initial hospital, without considering the effect of indirect trajectories through the network. We determine the optimal way to measure the distance between hospitals within the network, by reconstructing the English hospital network based on shared patients in 2014-2015, and simulating the spread of a hospital-associated pathogen between hospitals, taking into consideration that each intermediate hospital conveys a delay in the further spread of the pathogen. While the risk of transferring a hospital-associated pathogen between directly neighbouring hospitals is a direct reflection of the number of shared patients, the distance between two hospitals far-away in the network is determined largely by the number of intermediate hospitals in the network. Because the network is dense, most long distance transmission chains in fact involve only few intermediate steps, spreading along the many weak links. The dense connectivity of hospital networks, together with a strong regional structure, causes hospital-associated pathogens to spread from the initial outbreak in a two-step process: first, the directly surrounding hospitals are affected through the strong connections, second all other hospitals receive introductions through the multitude of weaker links. Although the strong connections matter for local spread, weak links in the network can offer ideal routes for hospital-associated pathogens to travel further faster. This hold important implications for infection prevention and control efforts: if a local outbreak is not controlled in time, colonised patients will appear in other regions, irrespective of the distance to the initial outbreak, making import screening ever more difficult.",,"biology; computer simulation; contact examination; cross infection; Disease Outbreaks; England; hospital; human; procedures; statistics and numerical data; supply and distribution; transmission; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Contact Tracing; Cross Infection; Disease Outbreaks; England; Hospitals; Humans",,,,15537358,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027965168

In this paper, a sustainable model has been proposed to design a supply chain network in textile industries considering the key environmental and social factors. Regarding the type of industry and characteristics of the area under study (Zanjan, northwest Iran), minimizing the negative effects of wasteful extraction of ground waters and the environmental pollution resulting from industrial wastewaters and maximizing justicebased employment were considered. The supply chain consists of the following elements: suppliers, plants, distribution centers, water refinery centers, and customer zones. One of the important features of the proposed model is that it considers the lost opportunity cost of facilities and focuses on wastewater recycling in water refineries. To solve the model, the Multi-Objective Vibration Damping Optimization (MOVDO) algorithm has been used. In addition, to evaluate the proposed model, as a case study, the supply chain network design problem was solved in textile industry.

In addition, globalization, increasing the regulations of governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers' request and pressure regarding environmental issues has led organizations to evaluate the measures necessary to implement green supply chain management, to improve their environmental and economic performance. The subject of selecting and evaluating suppliers on green supply chain with resilience capability first requires the identification of the supplier evaluation criteria so that it considers the resiliency of the supply chain concurrent with the concepts of green supply chain. Secondly, right tools should be used for the decision. Considering all the criteria and indicators in conditions of uncertainty encourages the development and application of methods, such as fuzzy theory and grey systems theory. In this research, a comprehensive model for evaluating green resilience supply chain network is provided. In order to apply both quantitative and qualitative criteria, the possibility of making the target based criteria dimensionless along the cost or benefit criteria, the use of experts' opinions in the allocation of weights to the criteria and indicators using grey numbers, grey relational analysis are developed and improved. In the end, the implementation of the proposed model is explained step by step in a case study and the future conclusions and recommendations are suggested. © 2017 by the authors.","Green resilient supplier selection; Grey relational analysis; Supply chain network; Target-based criteria","assessment method; decision analysis; environmental economics; environmental issue; globalization; government relations; multicriteria analysis; nongovernmental organization; numerical model; prioritization; regulatory approach; resource allocation; supply chain management",,"Ebrahimnejad, S.; Department of Industrial Engineering, Iran; email: ibrahimnejad@kiau.ac.ir","MDPI",20711050,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027721626

The manufacturer may not directly dictate which tier 2 suppliers are used but may influence the sourcing decisions of tier 1 suppliers via contract parameters. The manufacturer's optimal strategy depends critically on the degree of overlap in the supply chain: if tier 1 suppliers share tier 2 suppliers, resulting in a ""diamond-shaped"" supply chain, the manufacturer relies less on direct mitigation (procuring excess inventory and multisourcing in tier 1) and more on indirect mitigation (inducing tier 1 suppliers to mitigate disruption risk). We also show that while the manufacturer always prefers less overlap, tier 1 suppliers may prefer a more overlapped supply chain and hence may strategically choose to form a diamond-shaped supply chain. This preference conflict worsens as the manufacturer's profit margin increases, as disruptions become more severe, and as unreliable tier 2 suppliers become more heterogeneous in their probability of disruption however, penalty contracts-in which the manufacturer penalizes tier 1 suppliers for a failure to deliver ordered units-alleviate this coordination problem. © 2016 INFORMS.","Disruption risk; Multiple tiers; Multisourcing; Supply chains","Disasters; Supply chains; Coordination problems; Multi-tier; Multiple tiers; Multisourcing; Natural disasters; Optimal strategies; Profit margin; Supply networks; Manufacture",,,"INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences",00251909,,MSCIA,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027375794

Recent studies emphasize that artificial intelligence approaches obtain better performance than conventional methods in evaluating the suppliers’ performance and determining the best suppliers. Hence, this study proposes a new robust genetic-based intelligent approach, namely gene expression programming (GEP), to improve the supplier selection process for a supply chain and to cope with the drawback of the other intelligent approaches in this area. The applicability of this method was exhibited by a case study in the textile manufacturing industry. To show the performance of the mathematical-genetic model, comparisons with four intelligent techniques, namely multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, radial basis function (RBF) neural network, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and support vector machine (SVM), were performed. The results derived from the intelligent approaches were compared by using a collected dataset from a textile factory. The obtained results demonstrated that first the GEP-based model provides a mathematical model for the suppliers’ performance based on the determined criteria, and the developed GEP model is more accurate than the four other intelligent models in terms of accuracy in performance estimation. In addition, to verify the validity of the developed model, different statistical tests were used and the results showed that the GEP model is statistically powerful. © 2017, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Artificial intelligence; Gene expression programming; Performance evaluation; Supplier selection; Supply chain management","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Functions; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Gene expression; Genes; Genetic programming; Radial basis function networks; Support vector machines; Textile industry; Textiles; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Gene expression programming; Multiple criteria decision making; Performance evaluation; Radial basis function neural networks; Supplier evaluation and selections; Supplier selection; Supply chain managements (SCM); Supply chain management",,"Fallahpour, A.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Malaysia; email: fallahpour.a@gmail.com","Springer Berlin Heidelberg",15622479,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027039677

Such markets are traditional forms, continuously and deeply rooted in households’ everyday provision strategies, whereas food cooperatives are typical Alternative Food Networks inspired by Western experiences and have only existed in Poland for a few years. The two forms have distinct similarities, as they refer to directness and locality and are critical of dominant, mass economic institutions. However, the analysis of consumers’ interviews points to clear differences rooted in historical and structural determinants. These differences result in their different dynamic and contrasting roles in the food system and food culture of Poland. Owing to their inclusiveness and comparative popularity, open-air markets in Poland offer a universally accessible source of fresh produce. Furthermore, their strong social embeddedness increases their capacity to adapt to the current economic conditions and clients’ needs. The social-network nature of cooperatives, meanwhile, results in limitations in the scope of their operation, yet at the same time leads to innovative solutions and political narratives that are critical toward the mainstream food system. The criticism of markets, on the other hand, is based on conservative resistance, related to everyday food practices, private experiences, cultural values, and nostalgia. © 2017, © 2017 SAGE Publications.","food cooperatives; food markets; Poland; postsocialist economy; social relations",,,"Kopczyńska, E.; Institute of Sociology, Poland","SAGE Publications Inc.",08883254,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025480591

This research pilots a method for understanding the geographic patterns of local food supply chains in relation to the social networks formed through farm tours, byproduct sales, farm-to-farm collaboration, and donations to the local food bank.

A number of crossbow bolts from two military outposts there were examined to infer technological and political environments of this region. The analytical results reveal evidence of an established bolt-manufacturing technology based on the Cu-Sn-Pb system typical of the Han dynasty. It was also found that alloys within a specific composition range were most frequently selected as a preferred material. In many cases, however, the tin and lead contents were significantly away from this standard formula. Moreover, the dependency on non-standard methods showed notable variation between the outposts under consideration. The above results demonstrate that these sites shared in a common tradition based on a Han dynasty standardized model, but differed significantly in the implementation of these standards. The non-standard technologies likely represented manufacturing away from well-supplied production centers and reflected shifting frontier environments that often imposed restrictions on transport, communications, and access to material or technological resources. The occurrence of such alloys, therefore, may be indicative of the nature of supporting systems available to these peripheral sites. This observation suggests that crossbow bolts might serve as a medium for clarifying complex and dynamic border situations in terms of supply chains, interaction networks, and political affiliations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bronze technology; Crossbow; Frontier; Han dynasty; Mongolia; Xiongnu",,"NRF: NRF-2016-K2A9A2A19938859","Park, J.-S.; School of Materials Science and Engineering, Jochiwon, South Korea; email: jskpark@hongik.ac.kr","Elsevier Ltd",2352409X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021404607

The problem involves the transportation of bulk food grain by capacitated vehicles from surplus states to deficit states through silo storage. A mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is formulated which seeks to minimize the overall cost including bulk food grain shipment, storage, and operational cost. The model incorporates the novel vehicle preference constraints along with the seasonal procurement, silo storage, vehicle capacity and demand satisfaction restrictions. The management of Indian food grain supply chain network is more intricate and difficult issue due to many uncertain interventions and its chaotic nature.

Projects to ‘link pastoralists to markets’ in rural northern Kenya, place an emphasis on pastoral producers without adequate understanding of other inter-related actors whose activities and relations make up the connection to primary, secondary, regional and terminal markets. In this article, sheep and goat supply chains originating in Marsabit South are analyzed as a human activity system composed of the actions of supply chain actors and shaped by the relations between them. The geographically confined areas from which local markets receive the supply of sheep and goats are conceptualized as a “producer catchment area” depicted as finely branched tributaries through which livestock are moved towards terminal markets. A stakeholder analysis resulted in the identification of six categories of local traders who connect with other actors in both local and long distance supply chains to sustain the movement of sheep and goats to markets. The categories of traders are distinguished by different demands in travel, labour, working capital, risk exposures, and relations with other actors. In order to deal with variable and uncertain supply, local traders harness their social relations with other actors in the supply chain. However, local traders are at the highest risk for loss due to fluctuations in demand at the terminal market, as they depend on market information through brokers and lack relations to clients at the terminal market. This research demonstrates how systematic analysis of activities performed by actors, the interconnected activities linking them, and their relationships can offer insight for improved supply chain coordination. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Activity links; Actor network; Goats; Northern Kenya; Pastoral livestock production; Supply chain","actor network theory; goat; livestock farming; pastoralism; terrain; trade; Kenya; Marsabit; Capra hircus; Ovis aries","BMBF; BMZ: 031A247D","Roba, G.M.; German Institute for Tropical and Subtropical Agriculture (DITSL), Steinstrasse 19, Germany; email: guyo.roba@ditsl.org","Elsevier Ltd",07430167,,JRSTF,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021127057

Blood donation is a voluntary activity and blood donors are important in the blood supply chain. It is suitable to attempt to increase blood donors’ utility in order to reduce shortages and harmful damages. Parameters including distance of blood donors from blood facilities, experience factor of donors in blood facilities and advertising budget in blood facilities are considered social aspects and applied to form utility function used in this paper. The aim was to increase utility and motivate blood donors to donate blood. First, a deterministic location-allocation model is proposed applying a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization. Due to the stochastic nature of demand and cost parameters, the aforementioned model is developed to incorporate uncertainty using a robust optimization approach that can overcome the limitations of scenario-based solution methods, i.e., without excessive changes in complexity of the underlying base deterministic model. The application of the proposed model is evaluated by a case study in Tehran. Numerical results obtained and sensitivity analysis helps administrators in the decision making process for investment projects. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Blood donor's utility; Blood supply chain design; Location-allocation; Permanent and temporary facilities; Robust optimization; Uncertainty","blood; demand analysis; location-allocation model; network design; optimization; stochasticity; supply chain management; uncertainty analysis; Iran; Tehran [Iran]",,"Ramezanian, R.; Department of Industrial Engineering, Iran; email: ramezanian@kntu.ac.ir","Elsevier Ltd",13665545,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020407949

The rationality and self-centredness of these players causes the information asymmetry in the supply chain and thus situation of conflict and non-participation of the players in the network design process. In such situations, it is required to analyse the supply chain players' behaviour in order to explore potential for coordination through incentives. In this paper, a novel approach of social utility analysis is proposed to elicit the information for supply chain coordination among the supply chain players in a dyadic relationship - supplier and buyer. In principal, we consider a monopsony situation where buyer is a dominant player. With the objective of maximizing the social utility, efforts have been made to value behavioural issues in supply chain. On the other hand, the reluctance of player due to the information asymmetry is measured in the form of inertia - an offset to the supply chain profit. The suppliers' behaviour is analysed with three distinct level of risk for two types of the product in procurement process. The useful insight from this paper is in supplier selection process where the reluctance of supplier offsets supply chain profit.

A novel two-level Markov chain Monte Carlo particle filter method for joint estimation of demand and roughness is proposed in this paper. First, an improved particle filter with ensemble Kalman filter modification to proposal density is adopted to track the non-Gaussian system dynamics and estimate demands. Then, the improved particle filter for demand estimation is nested into the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation for roughness estimation. The method is very capable of quantifying the uncertainties associated with estimated or predicted values without requiring any assumptions of linearity and Gaussianity or any derivatives to be calculated. A strong nonlinear benchmark network with synthetically generated field data is utilized to validate the performance of this method. The results suggest that the proposed method is demonstrated to provide satisfactory demand and roughness values with reliable confidence limits.

The large geographic scale of Brazil nut exploitation and the significant contributions to local livelihoods, national economies, and forest-based development over the last decades, merit a review of the “conservation-through-use” paradigm. We use Elinor Ostrom’s framework for assessing sustainability in socioecological systems: (1) resource unit, (2) users, (3) governance system, and (4) resource system, to determine how different contexts and external developments generate specific conservation and development outcomes. We find that the resource unit reacts robustly to the type and level of extraction currently practiced; that resource users have built on a self-organized system that had defined boundaries and access to the resource; that linked production chains, market networks and informal financing work to supply global markets; and that local harvesters have used supporting alliances with NGOs and conservationists to formalize and secure their endogenous governance system and make it more equitable. As a result, the Brazil nut model represents a socioecological system that may not require major changes to sustain productivity. Yet since long-term Brazil nut production seems inextricably tied to a continuous forest cover, and because planted Brazil nut trees currently provide a minimal contribution to total nut production basin-wide, we call to preserve, diversify and intensify production in Brazil nut-rich forests that will inevitably become ever more integrated within human-modified landscapes over time. © 2017, The Author(s).","Amazonia; Deforestation; Forest conservation; Local livelihoods; Non-timber forest products; Tropical forest","agroforestry; anthropogenic effect; assessment method; conservation planning; deforestation; exploitation; forest cover; livelihood; nontimber forest product; nut; rainforest; sustainability; tropical forest; Amazon Basin; Amazonia; Brazil; Bertholletia excelsa","DFID","Guariguata, M.R.; Center for International Forestry ResearchPeru; email: m.guariguata@cgiar.org","Springer Netherlands",09603115,,BONSE,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018803030

Conventional water quality monitoring programmes are not always able to detect a microbial contamination of drinking water. In the drinking water production chain, in addition to the vulnerability of source waters, the distribution networks are prone to contamination. In this study, a pilot-scale drinking-water distribution network with an on-line monitoring system was utilized for detecting bacterial intrusion. During the experimental Escherichia coli intrusions, the contaminant was measured by applying a set of on-line sensors for electric conductivity (EC), pH, temperature (T), turbidity, UV-absorbance at 254 nm (UVAS SC) and with a device for particle counting. Monitored parameters were compared with the measured E. coli counts using the integral calculations of the detected peaks. EC measurement gave the strongest signal compared with the measured baseline during the E. coli intrusion. Integral calculations showed that the peaks in the EC, pH, T, turbidity and UVAS SC data were detected corresponding to the time predicted. However, the pH and temperature peaks detected were barely above the measured baseline and could easily be mixed with the background noise. The results indicate that on-line monitoring can be utilized for the rapid detection of microbial contaminants in the drinking water distribution system although the peak interpretation has to be performed carefully to avoid being mixed up with normal variations in the measurement data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bacterial contamination; Drinking water distribution; On-line measurement; Water quality monitoring","chlorine; copper; drinking water; iron; coliform bacterium; drinking water; electrical conductivity; pH; turbidity; ultraviolet radiation; water planning; water quality; World Wide Web; Article; bacterial count; bacterial intrusion; bacterial phenomena and functions; bacterium contamination; bacterium detection; electric conductivity; Escherichia coli; light absorption; noise; nonhuman; online monitoring; pH; plate count; sensor; turbidity; water contamination; water quality; water supply; water temperature; microbiology; water quality; water supply; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Drinking Water; Escherichia coli; Water Microbiology; Water Quality; Water Supply",,"Ikonen, J.; Water and Health Unit, P.O.

In fact, sustainability based approaches demand operations management boundaries' expansion, creation and integration of new performance goals into traditional company's performance management system, and new criteria and policies for operations' decision areas development. The challenge is to conduct more sustainable operations through companies' value chain and their operations network. Maturity models have been used in different areas as a process improvement and change management model for complex contexts. In sustainable operations management area, maturity models have been developed for specific purposes, e.g., sustainable production, sustainable supply chain management, corporate social responsibility, and life cycle management. However, there is a lack of models that considers sustainability integration through the evolution of sustainable operations' capabilities in an integrated way. Based on literature review and results from two panel studies conducted with academics and practitioners, this paper proposes a maturity framework for sustainability integration guided by sustainable operations capabilities evolution. The findings pointed out that its is possible to identify an evolutionary path, which goes from an initial approach focused in compliance aspects and firm's value protection to an innovative approach, based on corporate social responsibility supporting operations' integration in a sustainable system, and long-term values development. The experts' studies identified key processes that need to be prioritized in each level, and also evaluate the adaptation of some elements from Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) to sustainable maturity framework design.

To confront these challenges, this paper integrates computational experiment and data analysis, and proposes a methodology for data-driven computational experiments for inter-organizational collaborations in supply chain networks. It explores a paradigm shift to the development of data-driven computational experiments that supports decision making in the domain of inter-organizational collaborations. A basic principle for integrated solutions generation in the parallel worlds of virtual reality interaction is studied and the corresponding key issues in the paradigm are analyzed. To support the paradigm and solve key issues, a six-layered framework with four viewpoints for data-driven computational experiments is proposed. This framework systematically presents conceptual and technical solutions for data-driven computational experiments and decision support in the domain of inter-organizational collaborations in supply chain networks. The effectiveness of the framework is verified by theoretical analysis and a case study. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Computational experiment; Data-driven; Inter-organizational collaboration; Supply chain network","Decision making; Decision support systems; Supply chains; Virtual reality; Big data applications; Computational experiment; Data driven; Integrated solutions; Interorganizational collaboration; Supply chain network; Technical solutions; Virtual reality interactions; Big data",,,"Elsevier Inc.",00200255,,ISIJB,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014906711

The transportation spot market is a mechanism by which unfulfilled and urgent demand is satisfied. Shipments are tendered one at a time on a load-by-load basis. Because of the often severe shortage of spot market capacity and its relatively high and volatile prices, shippers must actively as opposed to passively seek carrier capacity. Often, they turn to third parties. This research considers third party brokers (3PL, or non-asset carriers) operating in the spot market. On behalf of shippers, these brokers take responsibility for shipments and secure capacity for them. The paper proposes a behaviourally-based conceptual framework that uses 3PL broker data to improve the search for capacity on the spot market. It seeks to improve the effectiveness of the search process by combining (1) broker data on the availability of carrier capacity, (2) a priori information on a particular carrier's likely response to various prices to service a load (the reservation price), and (3) the ability to source multiple loads simultaneously (bundling). These components are incorporated into a framework that enables brokers to better prioritize the carriers they contact, thereby improving outcomes in terms of lower carrier costs and reduced search effort. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Carrier decisions; Freight behaviour; Third party logistics; Transportation spot market; Truckload trucking","Costs; Outsourcing; Ships; Supply chains; Truck transportation; Trucks; Carrier decisions; Freight behaviour; Spot market; Third party logistics; Truckload trucking; Commerce; cost analysis; freight transport; logistics; market conditions; shipping; supply chain management; transportation economics; trucking",,"Mahmassani, H.S.; Transportation Center, 600 Foster Street, United States; email: masmah@northwestern.edu","Elsevier Ltd",09658564,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008869973

Thus, firms have an essential need to strive for acquiring the competitive advantage. Supply chain agility (SCA) is a tool which enable to assist firms to attain the competitive advantage. Therefore, this study benchmarks the core competencies from a case study within the supply chain network and establishes a set of attributes for augmenting SCA. A novel multi-criteria decision-making structure is proposed to deal with the complex interrelationships among the aspects and attributes. Fuzzy Delphi method uses for screening out the unnecessary attributes, then integrating fuzzy set theory with decision-making trials and evaluation laboratory method and closed-loop analytical network process to evaluate the SCA in determining the core competitive advantage.

The opening of new and existing markets requires that products and packages move through various regions of the world using available logistical equipment and networks at a faster pace. It also requires that damage be kept at a minimum while providing maximum safety to individuals. This can be achieved by properly designing packages to transportation levels that occur in the supply chain. The purpose of this research is to both measure and analyse the vibration physical forces that occur during rail transport. Rail shipments are widely used across the world, and they are an integral part of the intermodal transfer of ISO containers from ships and trucks to rail. The aim of this paper is to provide vibration levels measured for rail shipments on a major railway line in Central Europe that has not been previously published. The vibration levels that were measured in this study were compared with American Society of Testing and Materials, United States Military Standards and United Kingdom Defense Standard standards and International Safe Transit Association procedures in the form of power spectral density spectrums. A composite power spectral density spectrum is provided which can be used to simulate the measured rail vibration levels in Central Europe.

Although these theory-based models have been successful in identifying and explaining consumer behavior, their fixed nature necessitates customization efforts when applied to a specific usage context. In this paper, we utilized critical incident technique (CIT) as a complementary approach to IS user behavior study to traditional theory-based models in the context of the smartphone market. Through a two-stage survey, both positive and negative critical incidents are collected, which are categorized into device, device-related services, network services and content services. Then, their impacts on user intention variables of loyalty and recommendation are derived by a structural equation analysis of 795 smartphone users’ responses. The results can be summarized as follows: Positive critical incidents improve user intentions whereas negative ones worsen them; among the positive incidents, the events related to network services are the most influential; Critical incidents related to application contents are the most influential among the negative; Mobile device manufacturers are the most strongly affected by critical incidents among the smartphone supply chain parties. Merits of CIT in IS user behavior study have been demonstrated: CIT’s flexible nature provides convenience in adapting to a particular IS usage context; Both positive and negative incidents are examined, yielding a complementary implication to other methods. We also revealed that a conventional wisdom of CIT to focus mainly on negative critical incidents might have to be adjusted since positive ones might be more influential depending on the particular context of IS usage. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Critical incident technique; Loyalty; Smartphone; Structural equation analysis; Word-of-mouth",,,"Oh, J.; Business School, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, South Korea; email: joh@snu.ac.kr","Springer Verlag",16179846,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966470732

His curiosity about how change emerged over time led him to explore complexity at the edge of many fields, including mathematics, philosophy, physics, and computer science. His passion for pragmatic applications led him to engage in complex patterns of individual and institutional behavior as it emerged in the real world. Kevin pioneered the use of inductive quantitative data analysis to understand options and influence decision-making and action in complex social, business, and natural environments. Rather than positing a hypothesis, then testing it with data, as most change researchers usually do, Kevin analyzed data as it was generated and looked for the patterns. He then used those patterns to understand and influence change in complex human systems. He used the principles of complex adaptive systems sciences to see, understand, and improve patterns in teams, organizations, and processes. At various times in his career, he was engaged with total quality management, process analysis and improvement, and supply chain management. He held the first joint chair in engineering and business at the Arizona State University and continues to explore the sometimes chaotic intersection between physical and social systems.

The available woodfuel of Eucalyptus globulus suitable for energy use was calculated based on a WISDOM database (Woodfuel Integrated Supply/Demand Overview Mapping) which takes into account physical and legal accessibility of the resource. Available woodfuel is defined as the material remaining on the ground (crown and bark) after harvesting Eucalyptus stems, discounting the volume required to meet the current energy demand. Various spatial analyses were performed using ArcGIS 10.2.1, particularly the Network Analyst tool, to identify the optimized location of the new power plant. Then, considering the most common biomass harvesting system in a specified region, the costs and GHG emissions of the supply chain for this demand point were calculated. Total costs were calculated using machine productivity data and minimized distance calculation and GHG emissions by the amount of CO2e emitted, based on the Life Cycle Analysis methodology using productivity and fuel consumption data. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out to test the influence of moisture content and transport distances on the total cost and the GHG emissions. The results show that bundling was the highest cost (63.67% of total costs), followed by trucking (26.80%) and forwarding (9.53%). The GHG emissions for the whole system were 9.17 Kg CO2e/MWh, with the trucking being the greatest contributor, and bundling the second. The energy balance ratio (energy required as a percentage of energy produced by the system) was slightly over 2%, demonstrating high efficiency. The methodology presented here will help policy makers to evaluate possible locations for any future wood-fired power plants in terms of the lowest economic costs of supplying woodfuel and its environmental impact. This study extends on the scope of prior research, providing a realistic and detailed methodology for planning and logistics decision making in relation to the dynamization and sustainability of woodfuel for energy use. © 2017","Accessibility; GIS analysis; Harvesting costs; Life cycle assessment; WISDOM; Woodfuel","Costs; Decision making; Environmental impact; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Harvesting; Life cycle; Location; Productivity; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Trucks; Wood fuels; Accessibility; GIS analysis; Harvesting costs; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); WISDOM; Cost benefit analysis",,"Sánchez-García, S.; CETEMAS, Sustainable Forest Management Area. s/n, Spain; email: ssanchez@cetemas.es","Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019480662

Additive Manufacturing (AM) is considered by research studies as pioneering and disruptive technology that can drive such a transformation. This paper is aimed at investigating in what measures can additive manufacturing techniques adopted as an opportunity for the supply chain in SMEs. Initially, the literature review looks into needs and challenges of SMEs in the SC identifying solutions and strategies. The research further analyses AM's impact on the supply chain, evaluating benefits and drawbacks that AM delivers in this context. IT aims to examine the use of strategic maps, analytical tools and suitable tactical paths to implement and integrate this technology within supply chain. The paper describes the potential effects of the open sources networks and hence argues that a gradual integration of AM with traditional technologies is a plausible way for small manufacturers. However, there are several innovative approaches, and this scenario is rapidly evolving. Material and machines costs reduction could deliver significant changes. Therefore, further and updated investigations from a supply chain perspective are recommended, especially looking at practical cases and examples for this study within this context. © 2017 IEEE.","additive manufacturing; innovation and disruptive technolgy; manufacturing; supply chain management","3D printers; Management science; Manufacture; Supply chain management; Costs reduction; Disruptive technology; Economic pressures; Innovative approaches; Literature reviews; Manufacturing techniques; Potential effects; Research studies; Industrial research",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063352,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027832509

However, this graph theoretic approach has also been applied to a broad range of problems with similar structure as PNS. In particular, recent work has demonstrated the similarity of PNS problems to input-output (IO) optimization problems; the latter class of problems has been applied for physical flows at scales ranging from process plant level to supply chain level. IO models have also been proposed to plan the allocation of human resource in organizations. In this work, a P-graph based approach to reallocation of human resources in an industrial plant during a transient crisis is presented. The model determines how personnel can be reassigned to allow a plant to operate at an alternative temporary steady state when the plant becomes short-handed due to a disruptive external event. This methodology is demonstrated using a representative case study involving an instant coffee plant. Results show that in the occasion that a reduction in available workforce is experienced, workforce is allocated in more critical areas and productivity is maximized by minimizing interaction with less critical departments. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Graph theory; Graphic methods; Optimization; Personnel; Process control; Supply chains; Uncertainty analysis; Coffee plants; Graph theoretic approach; Optimization problems; Physical flow; Process networks; Process plants; Representative case; Resource reallocation; Industrial plants","DOST-NRCP",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043972,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034086012

With traditional supply chain network design, companies define and optimise their own logistics networks, resulting in current logistics systems being a set of independent heterogeneous logistics networks. The concept of PI aims to integrate independent logistics networks into a global, open, interconnected system. Prior research has shown that new inventory models enabled by and applied to PI could help reduce inventory levels thanks to its high flexibility. Continuing along these lines, this paper examines how inventory models applying PI deal with disruptions at hubs and plants. To attain this, a single product inventory problem with uncertain demands and stochastic supply disruptions is studied. A simulation-based optimisation model is proposed to determine inventory control decisions. The results suggest that the PI inventory model, with greater agility and flexibility, outperforms the current classic inventory models in terms of resilience. Moreover, the difference in performance increases when the product value, penalty costs and disruption frequency increases.

Most theoretical research has used the popular Barabasi-Albert (BA) growth model, in which new nodes (firms) entering the network attach preferentially to the existing nodes with more links (contractual relationships), to generate network topologies supposedly representative of real world SCNs. This paper looks at real world SCN topologies using data presented in Willems (2008) and establishes a general set of topological characteristics for the manufacturing sector. Based on observations from twenty six SCNs, it is found that, although manufacturing SCNs exhibit power law node degree distributions, they tend to be hub and spoke like, with hubs that are significantly larger than those predicted by the BA model. Also, the SCNs indicated the presence of closely knit, vertically integrated communities of firms, while highly connected firms were found to avoid connecting with each other. Since the above structural properties are not features of the networks generated by the BA model, it is concluded that a new mechanism is required to model the growth of SCNs. © 2017 IEEE.","network topology; strategic supply chain management; supply chain network; supply network analysis","Engineering research; Manufacture; Supply chain management; Contractual relationships; Manufacturing sector; Network topology; Node degree distribution; Structural characteristics; Supply chain network; Topological characteristics; Topological properties; Topology",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509064915,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027870557

In a typical SCN model, nodes and links represent the firms and their exchange relationships, respectively. A key requirement in such SCN models is accounting for node and link level heterogeneity, which can be used to more realistically represent the intricacies of real world SCNs. However, this requirement remains largely unaddressed in the contemporary literature. Accordingly, this work attempts to customize the standard network theoretic growth models and resilience metrics, to more closely represent the real world SCN characteristics. In particular, the model proposed in this paper accounts for: (1) the evolution of SCNs through fitness based attachment, (2) the tiered nature observed in real world SCNs, (3) the value added process, from upstream to the downstream of a typical supply chain, which captures heterogeneity of nodes at each tier, (4) the heterogeneity in link weights, and (5) the partial functionality, instead of complete omission, of nodes when simulating failures. The simulation results presented indicate that the proposed model, which closely represents the specific heterogeneous features between the individual network constituents, can be effectively utilized to gain valuable insights on resilience characteristics of real world SCNs. © 2017 IEEE.","fitness based attachment; supply chain network; supply network evolution; supply network robustness","Engineering research; fitness based attachment; Heterogeneous features; Individual network; Nodes and links; Resilience metrics; Supply chain network; Supply networks; Value-added process; Supply chains",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509064915,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027864861

To study the role of Sustainability in Supply Chain Network Design (SSCND), we propose a new Multi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MMILP) model, which captures significant decisions involved in designing or re-designing high performance, sustainable supply chains. The cost objective includes investment, operational, as well as emissions costs. The environmental objective captures emission quantities and waste generation at each link of the supply chain. The social objective considers employment opportunities, prioritizing societal community development and improved labor conditions. To solve the proposed model we employ both goal programming and the ε-constraint method to achieve efficient trade-offs among the three objectives. We have successfully applied the proposed model to a large case study of a global manufacturer. The goal programming method results in both economic and environmental cost improvements, while maintaining social costs under control. The ε-constraint method provides the opportunity to regulate the expenditures related to environmental and social strategies.

This network structure can be optimized to minimize total cost or total inventory by deciding the order quantities and distribution of links connecting the facilities. However, bullwhip effect (i.e., amplification of order fluctuations) is an important performance metric for supply chains because as the order variance increases in the downstream of the supply chain (e.g., distributors), the demand variance in the upstream (e.g., manufacturer) amplifies and causes inefficiencies in the supply chain. In this study, we optimize supply chain network structure for multi-product multi-period two-echelon supply chain networks to minimize bullwhip. Due to nonlinear structure of the objective function, i.e., bullwhip effect, this paper proposes a differential evolution (DE) algorithms employing variable neighborhood search (VNS) and constraint handling methods to optimize supply chain network structure.

Steam cracking of NGLs produces a very different product slate than cracking naphtha. The structure of the chemical manufacturing industry has adapted to the change in steam cracker by-products through technology substitutions and incorporating on-purpose chemical manufacturing facilities for chemicals such as butadiene. These shifts in manufacturing structure can be captured with consequential modeling of chemical manufacturing but may not be accurately represented by attributional life-cycle inventories of individual chemical products. An attributional life-cycle inventory (LCI) was used to assess the changes in energy consumption and water use for polyethylene production as steam cracking feedstocks change. To assess the changes in ancillary supply chains affected by the cracking feedstock shift, a network model of the chemical industry was used for a consequential LCI. An attributional LCI shows a 9.94% reduction in energy consumption as the ethylene feedslate moves from 40% to 99% NGLs, whereas a consequential LCI shows a 5.44% reduction in energy consumption. More significantly, industry-wide process water use decreases 35% and cooling water use increases 40% in the consequential LCI as the ethylene feedslate moves from 40% to 99% NGLs. In comparison, the attributional LCI predicts reductions in both cooling water and process water and changes that are at last a factor of five smaller than the consequential approach. A small number of supply chains have a large contribution to overall energy and water use, and these changes in secondary supply chains are only accounted for in the consequential approach. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

It is a versatile source from which heat, electricity, and liquid biofuels can be generated. Its utilization can also improve energy security, the development of rural regions, and employment. The exploitation of the energy potential in biomass in a specific geographical region is frequently constrained by high production costs and the amount of land required per unit of energy generated. In addition, the distributed nature of the biomass resource and its normally low energy density may result in large transportation costs. Biomass also requires large land areas to collect and process the incoming solar radiation before the energy can be harvested. In line with this, there has been a growing interest, discussions, and publications of green technologies, concepts, and approaches for sustainable design and reduction. To link-up these green technologies from pretreatment to process and delivery, a green supply chain development is a key point in this green belt. Green biomass supply chain or sustainable network could be defined as the operational management method and optimization approach to reduce the environmental impact along the life cycle of the green product: from the raw material to the end product. These activities should lead to economic growth, environmental protection, and social progress in a region. To achieve a sustainable development, the supply chain not only focuses on transportation/logistic task.

Their obligatory use of mammalian dung has broad ecological implications, including providing economically and epidemiologically relevant ecosystem services. Beetle-mammal ecological networks are critically important in determining the resilience of dung beetle communities and the supply of beetle-mediated ecosystem functions. However, our understanding of dung beetle trophic networks remains incomplete. Here we report on a pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of DNA-based analyses in identifying the source of dung beetle meals. Using beetles collected from dung piles of known provenance, we hypothesized that molecular analysis of gut content would correctly identify the mammal host, and that beetle body size would increase the odds of successful detection of mammalian DNA. We analyzed 90 specimens belonging to six beetle species. Most samples yielded mtDNA sequences from the expected mammalian species, suggesting that these methods can be an efficient tool for the investigation of dung beetle diet. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Coleoptera; ecosystem service; feces; forensic genetics; trophic networks","mitochondrial DNA; mitochondrial DNA; analytical parameters; Article; beetle; body size; controlled study; DNA contamination; DNA extraction; gene sequence; genetic identification; gut content; meal; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; sequence analysis; validation process; analysis; animal; animal food; beetle; biodiversity; chemistry; classification; DNA sequence; ecosystem; feces; gastrointestinal tract; genetics; mammal; pilot study; procedures; Animal Feed; Animals; Beetles; Biodiversity; DNA, Mitochondrial; Ecosystem; Feces; Gastrointestinal Tract; Mammals; Pilot Projects; Sequence Analysis, DNA",,"Kolokotronis, S.-O.; Department of Biological Sciences, 441 East Fordham Road, United States; email: koloko@amnh.org","Taylor and Francis Ltd.",24701394,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020469898

This article plots the development and shape of opium commerce in the Transvaal colony, revealing local patterns of entrepreneurship and articulations between licit and illicit circuits in the narcotic supply chain. In a bid to monopolise control and profits, the Government set up a bureaucracy of drug provision, working with the Chamber of Mines and organised pharmacy and medicine interests. However, the continuing preference of indentured migrants for informal networks of supply, despite higher prices, points to the importance of the trade within the social and material economies of the mining compound. With political changes in both colony and metropole, and the termination of the Chinese Labour Importation scheme, the presence of opium on the Rand was drawn into the anti-opium politics of the imperial public sphere. White racial anxieties about the ‘spread’ of opium smoking were crystallised in the image of the opium den as a locus of depravity. However, it was neither moral nor social arguments, but rather the expulsion of the population officially targeted for drug use, that curtailed the trade in opium on the Witwatersrand. © 2017 The Editorial Board of the Journal of Southern African Studies.",,"colonialism; drugs trade; economic history; historical geography; trade flow; trade performance; South Africa; Transvaal; Witwatersrand",,"Waetjen, T.; Department of Historical Studies, PO Box 524, South Africa; email: twaetjen@uj.ac.za","Routledge",03057070,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019638629

Therefore, obtaining reliable and precise information is crucial concerning forest resources and the appropriate methods of transportation. The main objective of this study was to improve the methodological approaches to forest road planning to improve the transportation of wood biomass in Russia. The results from the present study into the theoretical optimal road density revealed the importance of economic feasibility and cost-effectiveness when considering expansion of the forest road network. Cost reduction could be achieved through effective operational planning, which should also incorporate the costs for harvesting, road construction and transportation. However, no clear evidence was found regarding the best strategy to apply. The construction of high-quality forest roads should be concentrated in the forests with the largest standing volumes. However, in the near term, extended two-step forest transportation with 6*6WD trucks on the lowest quality roads (e.g. the cheapest basic forest roads) will continue to be an important part of the supply chain; it may even be more cost-efficient to maintain and upgrade these roads to allow all-year-round access with ordinary 6*4WD trucks rather than constructing new roads in these areas. Thus, zoning of the procurement area could be used for optimising forest road planning to maximise the mobilisation of wood biomass. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","mobilisation; Road planning; roundwood; Russia; wood biomass","Automobiles; Biomass; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Forestry; Roads and streets; Supply chains; Trucks; Wood; Mobilisation; Road planning; Roundwoods; Russia; Wood biomass; Highway planning","Minobrnauka: RFMEFI58615×0020","Lopatin, E.; Syktyvkar State University named after Pitirim Sorokin, Oktyabrskiy Prospect 55, Russian Federation; email: eugene.lopatin@forestrycloud.com","Taylor and Francis Ltd.",17597269,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017264784

Design/methodology/approach – The study applies social network analysis (SNA) to web-based EAB data for 38 journals listed under operations management (OM) in the 2010 ABS Academic Journal Quality Guide. Findings – The members of EABs of the 38 journals are divided into seven distinct communities which are mapped to the field’s knowledge structures and further aggregated into a core and periphery of the network. A burgeoning community of supply chain management academics forms the core along with those with more traditional interests. Male academics affiliated to the US institutions and to business schools predominate in the sample. Research limitations/implications – A new strand of research is opened up connecting journal governance networks to knowledge structures in the OSCM field. OM is studied separately from its reference and associated disciplines. The use of the ABS list might attract comments that the study has an implicit European perspective – however the authors do not believe this to be the case. Practical implications – The study addresses the implications of the lack of diversity for the practice of OM as an academic discipline. Social implications – The confirmation of the dominance of particular characteristics such as male and US-based academics has implications for social diversity of the field. Originality/value – As the first study of its kind, i.e. SNA of EAB members of OSCM journals, this study marks out a new perspective and acts as a benchmark for the future. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic communities; Governance; Journals; Networks",,,"Burgess, T.F.; Business School, United Kingdom; email: tfb@lubs.leeds.ac.uk","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",01443577,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049375579

This study deals with the emerging research problem of optimally dynamic combined decisions: retail price, stock depletion time/service level (SL) and replenishment schedule/quantity in a decentralised two-echelon perishable product collaborative network comprising a single supplier and a single retailer (buyer) over a finite multi-period planning horizon. Analytical solutions are derived using calculus with dynamic programming under two different trading policies, namely retailer-managed inventory with price-only (RMIPO) mode and vendor-managed inventory with consignment contract (VMICC) mode. In both models, shortages are allowed and are fully backlogged. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated using the case of a simple supply chain comprising a regional seafood supplier and a local branch store of a national retail chain. The results show that the VMICC policy yields lower retail price, larger replenishment quantity, higher SL and greater channel-wide profit than the RMIPO policy and achieves a win-win situation for both parties in the supply chain. Additionally, consumers benefit from lower retail price and higher SL in the VMICC policy. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","collaborative networks; pricing theory; shortages; supply chain management","Calculations; Commerce; Dynamic programming; Supply chain management; Collaborative network; Competitive prices; Consignment contracts; Optimisation models; Pricing theory; shortages; Supplier relationships; Vendor managed Inventory; Sales",,"Chen, L.-T.; Department of Commerce Automation and Management, Taiwan; email: ltchen@mail.nptu.edu.tw","Taylor and Francis Ltd.",0951192X,,ICIME,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018310925

Governance plays an important role as a strategy for the revival of such destinations to achieve a more productive, environmental, social and sustainable management structure. ‘Good’ governance of a destination depends on all the actors involved in the tourism network. Such governance requires a redefinition of relations between government and society and minimal boundaries between public and private sectors. This paper has analysed the level of implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in a tourist destination that is a biosphere reserve (BR), the island of Fuerteventura (Canary Islands, Spain), from a comprehensive approach involving a tourism supply chain (TSC) with private and public agents. The focal firms analysed within the TSC have been tourist accommodation establishments in Fuerteventura. The paper shows that the level of involvement of tourist accommodation in CSR is positive. However, this involvement is not sufficiently high to meet the requirements of a destination designated as a BR. Therefore, coordination policies should be developed that promote governance systems and further enhance sustainability in the destination. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","corporate social responsibility; governance; sustainable tourist destination; Tourism supply chain","corporate social responsibility; governance approach; nature reserve; small island state; supply chain management; sustainability; tourism; tourist attraction; tourist destination; Canary Islands; Fuerteventura; Las Palmas; Spain",,"Sanfiel-Fumero, M.Á.; Department of Business Management and Economic History, Spain; email: msanfiel@ull.edu.es","Routledge",09654313,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018192083

This study proposes to generalize the supply chain network of product flow by incorporating the database of the distances between ports and the product flow, in order to quantify the fuel consumed for importing a product. The fuel consumption quantified by the developed model can aid environmental scientists to arrive in a more comprehensive impact assessment. Furthermore, the study will assist policy and decision makers in the evaluation of supply chains.

The main objective is to maintain the inventory level at a desired one according to the customer demand while synchronizing the flows within a set of physical boundaries and constraints. In addition, we consider uncertainties on delay and adaptation times and we use the new setting of the algebraic estimation techniques to adapt and update the controller when any change occurs. These two methods lead to a simple design of the control algorithm without integration of any differential equation and without a need to any model to estimate, which yield to an efficient control action.

This is a typical logistic network which is affected by irregular demand resulting from contract and non-contract business strategies. Hence, existing forecasting methods that work excellent with smooth and linear demand patterns become less accurate with increasing erratic, lumpy and intermittent demands. Moreover, increasing number of stock keeping units (SKUs) in service supply chains have computational limitations. This is because of the fact that demand keep on fluctuating their demand classes that result in uncertainty and consequently, leads to higher target stock levels (TSL) and lower reorder point (ROP) to ensure higher customer satisfaction. This raises interest in using AI for service supply chains to improve demand forecast accuracy. In this paper, we present a survey of existing forecasting methods used in service and non-service supply chains to select best performing AI methods and performance measures, using ABC classification. Neural network (NN) and Mean Square Error (MSE), are subsequently modelled and used in aircraft spare parts supply chain using data collected from Dassault Aviation, as a function of most commonly used aggregated demand features. The results are compared with frequently and best performing forecast methods for intermittent demand as Croston, Croston SBJ and Croston TSB; and classical methods as moving average (MA) and single exponential smoothening (SES). The analysis and results suggest that NN with higher number of features improve demand forecast accuracy significantly for intermittent demands along with reduction in associated financial implications. © 2017","AI Methods; Business Jets; Demand Forecasting; Spare Parts Service Supply Chains","Aircraft; Aircraft manufacture; Customer satisfaction; Forecasting; Mean square error; Supply chains; Business jets; Computational limitations; Demand forecasting; Financial implications; Financial performance; Performance measure; Service supply chains; Spare parts service; Artificial intelligence",,,"Elsevier B.V.",24058963,,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044260572

In classical cross-dock, it is assumed that there is one truck for each supplier and customer. Yet, one truck for each supplier and customer can be very costly and consequently ineffective. Each truck likely can serve more than one supplier/customer in its pickup/delivery process. Therefore, to more actualize the cross-dock problem, it can be extended with the truck routing problem, i.e., the truck scheduling in the cross-docking system and truck routing in the pickup/delivery process. Hence, this paper considers the integrated truck routing and scheduling problem. First, the problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model. Using this model, we solve small-sized instances to optimality. Moreover, two metaheuristics, a reactive tabu search with path relinking and a generational genetic algorithm with a local search and restart phase, are proposed to solve large instances. The parameters of the proposed algorithms are tuned. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated. © 2017 EDP Sciences, ROADEF, SMAI.","Cross-docking; Metaheuristics; Supply chain; Truck routing scheduling","Cost reduction; Docking; Docks; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Hydraulic structures; Integer programming; Pickups; Scheduling; Supply chains; Tabu search; Crossdocking; Generational genetic algorithms; Meta heuristics; Mixed integer linear programming model; Reactive Tabu search; Routing and scheduling; Routing problems; Solution methods; Trucks",,,"EDP Sciences",28047303,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030535287

However, not all countries around the world equally emphasize the threat. For example, some countries still have not implemented any carbon dioxide emission regulations to address this problem. Carbon regulations in only subglobal areas may result in even higher global emissions because of carbon leakage. One possible approach to cope with the carbon leakage problem is to impose carbon tariffs on the goods from unregulated countries. In this paper, a mathematical model is built to explore the impacts of carbon tariff imposition on the supply chain network design, where the carbon tariff is imposed when the goods flow from unregulated countries to regulated countries. Moreover, our paper provides a complete experimental study by applying this model in a real case study, Company G, a major Taiwan-based multinational company in the electronic products industry. The outcomes demonstrate the conditions where the introduction of carbon tariffs forces firms from unregulated countries to take actions to reduce carbon emissions. © 2015 IEEE.","Carbon emissions; carbon leakage; carbon tariff; Green supply chain design; member society and nonmember society","Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Carbon emissions; Carbon leakage; Carbon tariffs; Green supply chain designs; member society and nonmember society; Supply chains",,"Gong, D.-C.; Department of Industrial and Business Management, Taiwan; email: gongdc101@gmail.com","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15455955,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027688901

We note the lack of any consolidated framework or generalized theory in this area. Different topics related to resilience are usually discussed in isolation; hence, this research has attempted to combine different concepts drawn from various areas into one framework. We postulate that food supply chains can develop certain capabilities such as agility, adaptability, and alignment within the four supply chain domains of logistics, collaboration, sourcing, and knowledge management. Supply chain orientation and risk management culture plays the facilitating role in this framework.

Within Europe, ATP FRC certified 13.6 meter long mono- and bi-temp trailers are the most common vehicles for domestic and international temperature controlled distribution. Each trailer has a mounted temperature controlled unit (TCU) at the front to generate enforced temperature controlled air circulation in the cargo space. The bi-temp trailer has in addition a second evaporator attached to the ceiling at the rear doors and a movable split wall that can divide the trailer cargo space at various positions to maintain different temperature regimes. Under the leadership of the Pharmaceutical Cold Chain Interest Group (PCCIG), global subject matter experts collected 72 requirements towards trailer equipment and operational handling to distribute pharmaceutical products at +2 °C to +8 °C and/or at +15 °C to +25 °C in these vehicles. By applying the collected requirements and guidance for FTL (Full Truck Load) and LTL (Less Than Truck Load) networks, the pharmaceutical industry and its supply chain partners can harmonize trailer equipment and operational handling. This will improve services and reduce cost and temperature excursions across the supply chains for temperature controlled road vehicles.

Supply chain network design provides a means to frame this issue in terms of strategic decision making. It has matured from a field that addressed only operational and economic concerns to one that comprehensively considers the broader environmental and social issues that face industrial organizations of today. Adding the term “green” to supply chain activities seeks to incorporate environmentally conscious thinking in all processes in the supply chain. The methodology is based on the use of Life Cycle Assessment, Multi-objective Optimization via Genetic Algorithms and Multiple-criteria Decision Making tools (TOPSIS type). The approach is illustrated and validated through the development and analysis of an Orange Juice Supply Chain case study modelled as a three echelon GrSC composed of the supplier, manufacturing and market levels that in turn are decomposed into more detailed subcomponents. Methodologically, the work has shown the development of the modelling and optimization GrSCM framework is useful in the context of eco-labelled agro food supply chain and feasible in particular for the orange juice cluster. The proposed framework can help decision makers handle the complexity that characterizes agro food supply chain design decision and that is brought on by the multi-objective nature of the problem as well as by the multiple stakeholders, thus preventing to make the decision in a segmented empirical manner. Experimentally, under the assumptions used in the case study, the work highlights that by focusing only on the “organic” eco-label to improve the agricultural aspect, low to no improvement on overall supply chain environmental performance is reached in relative terms. In contrast, the environmental criteria resulting from a full lifecycle approach is a better option for future public and private policies to reach more sustainable agro food supply chains. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Food production; Green supply chain network design; Multiobjective optimization; Organic labelling","Citrus fruits; Decision making; Ecodesign; Environmental management; Food supply; Fruit juices; Genetic algorithms; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Environmental performance; Food production; Green supply chain; Industrial organization; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Multiple criteria decision making; Strategic decision making; Supply chain network design; Supply chains","SEP; FP7: 288974; CONACYT","Azzaro-Pantel, C.; Laboratoire de Genie Chimique, 4 allée Emile Monso, BP84234, France; email: Catherine.AzzaroPantel@ensiacet.fr","Elsevier Ltd",03608352,,CINDD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019655353

On the one side, collaboration between port terminals and shipping liners can lead to costs savings and help achieve a sustainable supply chain, and on the other side, the optimization of operations and sailing times leads to reductions in bunker consumption and, thus, to fuel cost and air emissions reductions. To that effect, there is an increasing need to address the integration opportunities and environmental issues related to container shipping through optimization. This paper focuses on the well known Berth Allocation Problem (BAP), an optimization problem assigning berthing times and positions to vessels in container terminals. We introduce a novel mathematical formulation that extends the classical BAP to cover multiple ports in a shipping network under the assumption of strong cooperation between shipping lines and terminals. Speed is optimized on all sailing legs between ports, demonstrating the effect of speed optimization in reducing the total time of the operation, as well as total fuel consumption and emissions. Furthermore, the model implementation shows that an accurate speed discretization can result in far better economic and environmental results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Berth allocation problem; Container terminal operations; Green maritime logistics; Integer programming; Speed optimization","Containers; Integer programming; Optimization; Port terminals; Railroad yards and terminals; Ships; Speed; Supply chains; Transfer cases (vehicles); Berth allocation problem; Container terminal operation; Global trading system; Green maritime logistics; Mathematical formulation; Optimization problems; Speed optimization; Sustainable supply chains; Reservation systems; container terminal; cost-benefit analysis; environmental issue; logistics; maritime transportation; optimization; port operation; resource allocation; shipping",,"Iris, Ç.; Department of Management Engineering, 2800 Kgs.

The paper aims to analyse how the role of the plant in a manufacturing network affects the configuration of the flows of goods among plants, suppliers and customers and how this configuration, in turn, affects the extent of adoption and effectiveness of supply chain (SC) integration. Methodology. Three research questions are developed at the plant level and then investigated through Cluster analysis, MANOVA and regression, using data from an international survey (IMSS 6) featuring 364 plants, from 18 countries, which are part of an intra-company manufacturing network. Findings. Five configurations of flows of goods emerge from the analysis. These configurations appear to be related to the role of the plant in the network and partly to the effectiveness of SC integration practices, but not to their extent of adoption. Research limitations. Research limitations include the focus on specific industries (assembly industries) and limited size of the clusters, which did not allow for a deep investigation of each single cluster. Originality/value. The paper creates a bridge between two literature streams (manufacturing networks and SC management) by means of an innovative flow-based perspective that can help researchers and practitioners to disentangle the two interwoven perspectives. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Global Manufacturing Networks; IMSS; Supply Chain Management","Cluster analysis; Integration; Manufacture; Supply chain management; Flow based; Global Manufacturing Networks; IMSS; International survey; Manufacturing networks; Plant level; Research questions; Supply-chain integration; Industrial research",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",1741038X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016149860

For the manufacture of biofuels at the industrial scale, there is a need to optimize the overall associated supply chain. Among biofuels, the global market for the aviation biofuel has increased drastically, mainly due to the forecasted growth of the aviation sector. Nevertheless, the supply chain for the aviation biofuel has specific characteristics, which are different from the case of bioethanol and biodiesel. Therefore, this paper presents a general optimization approach for optimizing the supply chain of aviation biofuels. A case study is presented accounting for the projection of the Mexican government for implementing the use of aviation biofuel in the airport network. The application of the proposed approach generates very interesting solutions, which are grouped in a Pareto front; from these results, it can be highlighted that the demand for aviation biofuel in the Mexican market can be satisfied with a gross economic benefit of M US$ 1681 per year, and savings of 93% of carbon dioxide emissions. The generated information can contribute to the establishment of the sustainable supply chain for aviation biofuels in Mexico. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Aviation biofuel; Biofuels; Mexican airport network; Optimization; Supply chain","Biodiesel; Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; Fossil fuels; Global warming; International trade; Optimization; Supply chains; Airport network; Carbon dioxide emissions; Economic benefits; Efficient technology; General optimizations; Industrial scale; Optimal planning; Sustainable supply chains; Bioethanol","CONACYT: 239765","Ponce-Ortega, J.M.; Chemical Engineering Department, Mexico; email: jmponce@umich.mx","Springer Verlag",1618954X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011933755

In this paper, we consider a sustainable supply chain network design problem, where the capacity and the product flow along each link are design variables. We formulate it as a multi-criteria optimization problem. A bio-inspired algorithm is developed to tackle this problem. We illustrate how to design a sustainable supply chain network in three steps. First, we develop a generalized model inspired by the foraging behaviour of slime mould Physarum polycephalum to handle the network optimization with multiple sinks. Second, we propose a strategy to update the link cost iteratively, thus making the Physarum model to converge to a user equilibrium. Third, we perform an equivalent operation to transform a system optimum problem into a corresponding user equilibrium problem so that it is solvable in the Physarum model.

Moreover, to handle the uncertainty in data, a scenario-based robust optimization approach is applied.

This paper considers the optimal control of tandem queues in order to mitigate surface congestion at large airports. The taxi-out process is modeled by two queues in tandem: The first one represents aircraft in a congested ramp or apron area, and the second one reflects aircraft waiting in the departure runway queue. The evolution of the mean queue lengths are described using ordinary differential equations. The resulting model is used to determine the optimal gate release rate for departure flights, in order to control the lengths of queues on the airport surface. Simulations of the optimal control policy show a reduction in queue lengths, resulting in lower taxi-out times. © 2017 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).",,"Air transportation; Airports; Differential equations; Manufacture; Ordinary differential equations; Queueing theory; Supply chains; Taxicabs; Airport surfaces; Departure flights; Mean queue lengths; Nonstationary; Optimal control policy; Optimal controls; Queue lengths; Traffic flow; Fighter aircraft",,"Badrinath, S.; Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, United States; email: sandeepb@mit.edu","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",07431619,9781509059928,PRACE,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027063726

The important factors influencing the stock, the purchase decision and the quantity to buy are the supply time and the demand. The first factor may cause the shortage risk if it has exceeded a desired delay. The non-stationary demand can cause a dead stock i.e. an obsolescence risk. The latter two types of risk generate an additional costs for the purchasing and storage costs. To avoid these costs, these risks have to be known with high precision. Furthermore, Bayesian networks are among the tools used in risk management.

Tao runs locally or remotely in a web browser, freeing it from OS constraints to integrate simulation engines directly into application-specific websites. Modeling examples presented here include a chemical reaction, time-bound activity sequences, and an embedded simulation for real-time load balancing. To illustrate using Tao for research, Hyden's, single-run, global optimization algorithm was implemented. This extension enables Tao to optimize the design of dynamic systems such as queueing networks and supply chains in a single run. To demonstrate Tao's extensibility, the innovations of pending-intervals and a bioproduction stochastic scheduling algorithm were implemented. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Global optimization; Scheduling algorithms; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Activity sequence; Application specific; Embedded simulation; Global optimization algorithm; Simulation engine; Simulation software; Stochastic scheduling; Teaching and researches; Open source software",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",08917736,9781538634288,WSCPD,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044541528

The present study examines why managers often do not engage their firms in adaptations to climate change. Thereby the study focuses, in particular, on the lack of strategic adaptation, which we define as anticipatory and target-oriented action with the purpose of increasing resilience to climate change. In order to investigate causes of lacking strategic adaptation in firms, the study employs a behavioral perspective based on the reasoned action approach. Thus, the study examines how barriers and motivational factors jointly shape the non-adaptive behavior of firm managers. Such causes of non-adaptive behavior are examined by comparing different classes of non-adaptors based on a case study in the manufacturing industry of the Austrian state of Tyrol. The obtained results underline recent criticism on barrier-centered analyses of non-adaptation by demonstrating the importance of motivational factors. Moreover, results point to the changeable nature of the identified causes of non-adaptive behavior by clarifying interactions between them and by suggesting influences from background factors. © 2017 by the authors.","Actor-centered approach; Barriers; Behavioral perspective; Climate change adaptation; Manufacturing industry; Motivational factors","adaptive management; alpine environment; behavioral response; climate change; industrial practice; manufacturing; strategic approach; supply chain management; Austria; Tyrol",,"Meinel, U.; AlpS-Center for Climate Change Adaptation, Grabenweg 68, Austria; email: meinel@alps-gmbh.com","MDPI",20711050,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021656800

The five-year program, which is funded with a $630,410 National Science Foundation (NSF) grant, awards individual scholarships of up to $10,000 to online students who have bachelor's degrees in a STEM discipline and are enrolled in the Engineering, Project Management, or Integrated Supply Chain Management graduate programs. Because online programs often fall short of meeting the career guidance and student service needs of their students, this program was designed to provide an extraordinary level of professional support and personal interaction. As soon as they are accepted into the program, scholarship recipients are paired with an academic advisor, a peer mentor, and a champion, all of whom act as a support network for the scholar while they are working toward degree completion. The advisor provides program-specific assistance, such as selecting courses and completing graduation requirements. The peer mentor is a current student of the scholar's degree program, and helps the scholar establish educational goals and gain a better understanding of the discipline. The champion, who has an existing career in the scholar's desired field, provides the scholar with networking and professional development opportunities. In addition to receiving personal support, scholars are also presented with online resources. Scholar Spot programming is specific to the STEM Masters Scholars Program and offers online presentations from STEM professionals about relevant resources and opportunities. During the presentations, the scholars have the opportunity to interact with the presenters and ask questions. While other higher education institutions offer scholarship money to STEM students, the STEM Scholars Masters Program is the only one that is 100 percent online and contains a built-in support network for its scholars.

Contrary to the conventional relay networks, we consider the scenario that the relay is an energy harvesting (EH) node and has no embedded energy supply. But it is equipped with a rechargeable battery such that it can harvest and accumulate the harvested energy from RF signals sent by the source and co-channel interferers to support its operation. Leveraging the inherent feature of the considered system, we develop a novel accumulate-then-forward (ATF) protocol to eliminate the harmful effect of CCI. In the proposed ATF scheme, at the beginning of each transmission block, the relay can choose either EH operation to harvest energy from source and CCI or information decoding (ID) operation to decode and forward source's information while suffering from CCI. Specifically, ID operation is activated only when the accumulated energy at the relay can support an outage-free transmission in the second hop. Otherwise, EH operation is invoked at the relay to harvest and accumulate energy.

To understand the origins of water molecules in the PSII crystal structure, the accessibility of bulk water molecules to channel inner spaces in PSII was investigated using the water-removed PSII structure and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The inner space of the channel that proceeds toward the D1-Glu65/D2-Glu312 pair (E65/E312 channel) was entirely filled with water molecules from the bulk region. In the same channel, a diamond-shaped cluster of water molecules formed near redox-active TyrZ in MD simulations. Reorientation of the D2-Leu352 side chain resulted in formation of a hexagonal water network at the Cl-2 binding site. Water molecules could not enter the main region of the O4-water chain, which proceeds from the O4 site of the Mn4CaO5 cluster. However, in the O4-water chain, the two water binding sites that are most distant from the protein bulk surface were occupied by water molecules that approached along the E65/E312 channel, one of which formed an H-bond with the O4 site. These findings provide key insights into the significance of the channel ends, which may utilize water molecules during the PSII photocycle. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Binding sites; Bins; Chains; Crystal structure; Molecular dynamics; Bulk surfaces; MD simulation; Molecular dynamics simulations; Photosystem II; Water binding; Water molecule; Water networks; Water oxidation; Molecules; chloride; diamond; glutamic acid; leucine; manganese; oxygen; tyrosine; water; photosystem II; water; Article; binding site; carboxy terminal sequence; conformational transition; crystal structure; density functional theory; molecular dynamics; molecular model; molecule; oxidation reduction reaction; photosystem II; priority journal; proton transport; water permeability; water supply; chemistry; cyanobacterium; metabolism; photosystem II; X ray crystallography; Crystallography, X-Ray; Cyanobacteria; Models, Molecular; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Water","AMED; KAKEN: 17K15101, 26800224, JP22740276, JP26105012; CREST: JPMJCR1656; ","Ishikita, H.; Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, 4-6-1 Komaba, Japan; email: hiro@appchem.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp","American Chemical Society",00062960,,BICHA,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021142146

The studied supply chain faces two major risks: disruption of suppliers and tough competition from competitors. Any disruption in upstream level of the supply chain leads to an inability to meet demand downstream and causes market share to be lost to the competitors. For such a setting, a resilient topology is redesigned that can recover from and react quickly to any disruptive incidents. To this aim, we speculate there are three policies that can be used to mitigate the disruption risk, namely keeping emergency stock at the retailers, reserving back-up capacity at the suppliers, and multiple-sourcing. The problem is addressed using a mixed integer non-linear model to find the most profitable network and mitigation policies. We design a piecewise linear method to solve the model. Based on the data extracted from an automotive supply chain, practical insights of the research are extracted in a controlled experiment. Our analysis suggests that implementing risk mitigation policies not only work to the advantage of the supply chain by sustaining and improving its market share but also benefit customers by stabilizing retail prices in the market. Using the case study, we analyze the contribution of each risk strategy in stabilizing the supply chain's profit, market share, and retail price. Our analysis reveals that downstream “emergency stock” is the most preferable risk mitigation strategy if suppliers are unreliable. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Automotive industry; Competition; Disruption; Resilient supply chain; Supply chain management","Automotive industry; Commerce; Costs; Piecewise linear techniques; Profitability; Risk assessment; Sales; Supply chain management; Automotive supply chains; Controlled experiment; Disruption; Mitigation policies; Non-linear model; Piecewise linear; Risk mitigation strategy; Supply chain network design; Competition",,"Farahani, R.Z.; Department of Management, United Kingdom; email: R.Zanjiranifarahani@kingston.ac.uk","Elsevier B.V.",03772217,,EJORD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008401037

Agile BI incorporates both technical and process-oriented approach to development, management, and delivery of BI solutions. To achieve agile BI, supply chains must provide and establish the necessary infrastructure, architecture, tools and processes in a way that enables them to deliver BI systems capable of quickly and effectively adapting to the rapidly changing business needs and environment factors. However, most supply chains still lack methods, processes and tools to successfully design and implement these systems.

This study develops a model integrating retail network value and efficiencies with customer behaviour and performance. We validate the model using survey data from prominent U.K. retail store customers. Our data analysis shows that both loyalty and service operation attributes have positive significant impact on customer behaviour, while the service operation mediates the relationship between loyalty and customer behaviour. This result gives a new outlook to build managerial capability based on customer loyalty and service operations. Our results specifically show that the service operation attributes will indirectly influence the customers’ buying behaviour even in the presence of loyalty attribute such as promotion schemes.

Many production planning and control (PPC) problems are essentially optimisation problems, where the objective is to develop a plan that meets the demand at minimum cost or maximum profit. Because the underlying optimisation problem will vary in the different business and operation phases, it is important to think about optimisation in a dynamic mechanism and in a number of interlinked sub-problems at the same time. Cloud manufacturing has the potential to offer decision support as a service and medium of communication in PPC.

As a matter of fact, the successful implementation of such bioeconomy strategies will require more complex integrative processes, which go beyond the conventional '‘industrial ecology’' approaches. It will require extended cross-sectoral cooperations between the different associated industrial stakeholder groups, as well as the implementation of energy and material flow synergies to enable the production of products and by-products in cascade and coupled production schemes. These sustainable strategies also require that the priorities and concerns of regional stakeholder groups be acknowledged and incorporated in aligning the goals for sustainable production within wood-based bioeconomy regions. However, assessing and monitoring such integrative systems involves several challenges. Establishing operational monitoring systems must include the evaluation of the whole supply chain and process networks associated with the characteristic products of the evaluated region. Moreover, the assessment should be based on a detailed picture of the regional material flow systems, complemented with the monitoring of stakeholder preferences and priorities. They must also be able to include temporal elements, helping to identify the opportunities and risks of emerging cross-sectoral product options. To date no such integrative assessment methods exist in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to present based on the practical example of a case study region the assessment of the sustainability level of wood-based bioeconomy networks, applying an integrated methodology for Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). © 2017, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

This question has vexed analysts and policy-makers in the face of broad agreement that private voluntary regulation is not enough to reach the most vulnerable workers in global value chains. This paper documents an alternative arrangement of relational ties at the base of the global garment chain in Mewat, India. The arrangement involved a novel place-based partnership between a leading global buyer, Gap Inc., the government, exporters, local home-based embroidery workers and an embedded nonprofit that connected them all. This networked contracting system helped secure, for a period of time, goodworking conditions, decent wages and improved livelihoods for previously unprotected workers. The experiment’s success however bred its own challenges and the network continues to transform. The case highlights two points: first, that focusing beyond the factory-floor, on workers in place based territorial labour markets might be an important complement to sectoral strategies of workforce protection. Second, the case also suggests that diffusing good labour standards down and beyond firms within value chains will require an active and mediating role of the decentralized state. Such a state both regulates, learns and collaborates, and holds open a space for relational mediation among firms, labour, and civic actors to jointly reach workers in the lowest tiers of global subcontracting systems. © 2017, Indian Society of Labour Economics.","Garment industry; Global value chains; Home based workers; Labour protections","export; garment industry; government; labor standard; nonprofit organization; policy making; supply chain management; Haryana; India; Mewat",,"Tewari, M.; University of North Carolina at Chapel HillUnited States; email: mtewari@unc.edu","Springer",09717927,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041490348

In such applications, objects can be efficiently managed by attaching them with low-cost RFID tags and carefully monitoring them. The missing objects, therefore, can be identified by the readers in the RFID system. Most of prior missing tag identification protocols consider the ideal scenario that all the tags' IDs are known to the reader, which ignore that some tags with unknown IDs, called unknown tags, may be present in the system. In this paper, we investigate the problem of efficiently identifying the missing tags with a predefined reliability for large-scale RFID systems with unknown tags. We first propose a basic efficient and reliable missing tag identification protocol called B-ERMI. Then we propose an enhanced protocol called E-ERMI to further improve the efficiency. The parameters of our proposed ERMI protocols are optimized to minimize the execution time. We also conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the proposed ERMI protocols and the simulation results illustrate that the ERMI protocols outperform other existing ones. © 2014 IEEE.","Efficient and reliable protocols; missing tag identification; radio frequency identification (RFID) systems; unknown tags","Internet of things; Radio systems; Radio waves; Social sciences computing; Supply chain management; Warehouses; Emerging technologies; Extensive simulations; Internet of Things (IOT); Low-cost rfid tags; RFID systems; Tag identification; unknown tags; Warehouse management; Radio frequency identification (RFID)","NSF: 61502352; CISE: 1457262, 1461886; NSFC: 61309023; 2015CFB203; BK20150383; NKRDPC: 15-9-1-79-jch, 2014CB340600, 2015GGX101045; 16CX02059A",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",23274662,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028457402

For instance, the supply with wood fibres in future composite and wood panel production lines can rely on individual or cooperative operation of refinery plants. Also, the feedstock of lignocellulosic biorefineries can primarily be mobilized from raw wood resources or can be sourced from saw mill by-products and/or secondary wood resources. Finally, a major option for coupled use and integration of value added chains between biorefineries and wood manufacturing industries is the production of intermediary and auxiliary materials such as bio-based resins and adhesives for glue-laminated and cross-laminated timber products. Considering these scenarios of varying intensity in coupled use and cascade use of wood resources a baseline scenario was developed and assessed in this study, which serves as a basis for further LCA studies on extended scenarios. If these horizontal and vertical integration options really contribute to favourable reduction of environmental impacts along the bio-based value chains in bioeconomy regions, thereby remains a major question for further in-depth assessments. A life cycle-based approach has been used to model and evaluate the technological processes that take part in wood-based bio-polymer and wood processing supply chains. This work analyses the negative environmental impacts of a future wood-based bioeconomy network and compares its impacts with those of a traditional fossil-based production system. Results show that for the future bioeconomy system for seven out of 11 impact categories a relative advantage between 25 % to 130% of the initial impacts of fossil-based counterparts is attainable. As expected the global warming potential and the abiotic depletion potentials are building the top group with 130 % and 70 % respectively. The inventory analysis shows that the integration of regional and cross company supply chains and the minimization of fossil-based additives and auxiliaries and utility service installations offer further options for leveraging optimization scenarios. © 2017, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

Fault rupture, ground shaking, liquefaction, and co-seismic landslides caused severe damage to distributed infrastructure, and particularly transportation networks; large segments of the country's main highway, State Highway 1 (SHI), and the Main North Line (MNL) railway line, were damaged between Picton and Christchurch. The damage caused direct local impacts, including isolation of communities, and wider regional impacts, including disruption of supply chains. Adaptive measures have ensured immediate continued regional transport of goods and people. Air and sea transport increased quickly, both for emergency response and to ensure routine transport of goods. Road diversions have also allowed critical connections to remain operable. This effective response to regional transport challenges allowed Civil Defence Emergency Management to quickly prioritise access to isolated settlements, all of which had road access 23 days after the earthquake. However, 100 days after the earthquake, critical segments of SHI and the MNL remain closed and their ongoing repairs are a serious national strategic, as well as local, concern.

The study took the form of semi-structured interviews. Forty-one pharmaceutical companies and pharmaceutical wholesalers were invited to participate in the study. The pharmaceutical companies were the member organizations of Pharma Industry Finland (PIF) (N = 30) and the Finnish Generic Pharmaceutical Association (FGPA) (N = 7). One company which is a central player in the pharmaceutical market in Finland but does not belong to PIF or FGPA was also invited. The pharmaceutical wholesalers were those with a nationwide distribution network (N = 3). A total of 30 interviews were conducted between March and June 2016. The data were subjected to qualitative thematic analysis. The most common reasons behind medicine shortages in Finland were the small size of the pharmaceutical market (29/30), sudden or fluctuating demand (28/30), small stock sizes (25/30), long delivery time (23/30) and a long or complex production chain (23/30). The reasons for the medicine shortages were supply-related more often than demand-related. However, the reasons were often complex and there was more than one reason behind a shortage. Supply-related reasons behind shortages commonly interfaced with the country-specific characteristics of Finland, whereas demand-related reasons were commonly associated with the predictability and attractiveness of the market. Some reasons, such as raw material shortages, were considered global and thus had similar effects on other countries. © 2017 Heiskanen et al.

But it is often the underlying global supply chain structure that ultimately drives long-term success or failure, by facilitating profitable growth, minimizing operational costs, protecting intangible property assets, and limiting international risks. Building an efficient supply chain organization requires many elements to work together smoothly, from material sourcing and clearing regulatory obstacles to selecting production partners and developing a distribution network. It is often the case for life sciences companies that some of these elements require significant activities to be performed outside the home country (i.e., outside the United States). These international implications create complications that arise in a number of areas, such as managing the dispersed personnel of a global business and addressing the voluminous administrative burdens associated with tax, accounting, and legal rules in multiple jurisdictions. One obvious and potentially significant complication is international taxation.

We identify publicly traded supply chain partners using Bloomberg data and construct cosearch networks of supply chain partners based on the weekly coviewing pattern of these firms on Yahoo! Finance. Our analyses show that the cosearch intensity across supply chain partners helps determine cross-return predictability. When investors of a focal stock pay less attention to its supply chain partners, we can use lagged partner returns to predict the future return of the focal stock. When investors' coattention to focal and partner stocks is high, the predictability is low. Our simulated trading strategy using returns of supply chain partners with low coattention generates a significant and positive return above the market returns and performs better than the previously established trading strategy using returns of all supply chain partners. © 2017 INFORMS.","Correlated search; Network analysis; Online search; Stock returns; Supply chain; User attention","Commerce; Electric network analysis; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Online searching; Correlated search; Information diffusion; Novel applications; Stock return predictability; Stock returns; Supply chain partners; Supply chain relationships; User attention; Supply chains",,,"INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences",10477047,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021094695

Contemporary firms are using IOSs to collaborate widely across the value chain and in an ever-expanding geographic landscape. Thus, institutional distance, which is the difference between the firms' respective institutional fields, has become a prominent challenge. In this study, we investigate the extent to which institutional distance affects IOS-enabled knowledge sharing and its impact on the joint performance of collaborating firms. We also explore the extent to which IOS adaptability could be a design solution for improving IOS-enabled knowledge sharing, given the challenge of institutional distance. Drawing on institutional theory, we propose that institutional distance, differentially influential via its normative, cognitive, and regulative aspects, not only reduces IOS-enabled knowledge sharing but also weakens the positive impact of such sharing on joint firm performance. Next, extending boundary object theory to the institutional context, we propose that IOS adaptability could be a solution to the challenge of institutional distance because it can directly strengthen IOS-enabled knowledge sharing as well as mitigate the negative effect of institutional distance on such sharing. Our hypotheses were tested through a field study that collected dyadic data from 141 distinct buyer/supplier channel relationships in 4 industries. The results from partial least squares modeling fully support our hypotheses with regard to cognitive distance, partially support those related to normative distance, but do not support those related to regulative distance.We discuss the implications of these findings for theory development and professional practice. © 2017 INFORMS.","Adaptability; Boundary object; Channel relationship; Institutional distance; Interorganizational systems; IOS-enabled knowledge sharing; Supply chains and networks","Electric arc welding; Information management; Knowledge management; Least squares approximations; Supply chains; Adaptability; Boundary objects; Channel relationships; Institutional distance; Inter-organizational systems; Knowledge-sharing; Societies and institutions",,,"INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences",10477047,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021066109

The transient response of the quiescent current and output power (Pout) in GaAs HBT power amplifiers that consist of a main chain and a sub-chain is often affected by a thermal coupling between power stages and their bias circuits in the same chain or a thermal coupling between power stages and/or their bias circuits in different chains. In particular, excessively strong thermal coupling inside the MMIC SWPA causes failure in 3GPP-compliant inner loop power control tests. An experimental study reveals that both the preheating in the main/sub-chains and appropriate thermal coupling inside the main chain are very effective in reducing the turn-on delay for the two-parallel-amplifier-chain topology; for example, i) the sub-power stage is arranged near the main power stage, ii) the sub-driver stage is placed near the main driver stage and iii) the main driver bias circuit is placed near the main power stage and the sub-power stage. The SWPA operating in Band 9 (1749.9 to 1784.9 MHz), which was designed and fabricated from the foregoing considerations, shows a remarkable improvement in the Pout turn-on delay: a reduced power level error of 0.74 dB from turn-off to turn-on in the sub-amplifier chain and a reduced power level error of over 0.30 dB from turn-off to turn-on in the main amplifier chain. The main RF power measurements conducted with a 3.4-V supply voltage and a Band 9 WCDMA HSDPA modulated signal are as follows. The SWPA delivers a Pout of 28.5 dBm, a power gain (Gp) of 28 dB, and a PAE of 39% while restricting the ACLR1 to less than -40 dBc in the main amplifier chain. In the sub-amplifier chain, 17 dBm of Pout, 23.5 dB of Gp, and 27% of PAE are obtained at the same ACLR1 level.

Methods: Following the detection of high levels of Legionella contamination in a 136-bed general hospital water network, an HP treatment of the hot water supply (25 mg/L) was adopted. During a period of 34 months, the effectiveness of HP on Legionella colonization was assessed. Legionella was isolated in accordance with ISO-11731 and identification was carried out by sequencing of the mip gene. Results: Before HP treatment, L. pneumophila sg 2-15 was isolated in all sites with a mean count of 9950±8279 cfu/L. After one-month of HP treatment, we observed the disappearance of L. pneumophila 2-15, however other Legionella species previously not seen were found; Legionella pneumophila 1 was isolated in one out of four sampling sites (2000 cfu/L) and other non-pneumophila species were present in all sites (mean load 3000±2887 cfu/L). Starting from September 2013, HP treatment was modified by adding food-grade polyphosphates, and in the following months, we observed a progressive reduction of the mean load of all species (p < 0.05), resulting in substantial disappearance of Legionella colonization. Conclusion: Hydrogen peroxide demonstrated good efficacy in controlling Legionella. Although in the initial phases of treatment it appeared unable to eliminate all Legionella species, by maintaining HP levels at 25 mg/L and adding food-grade polyphosphates, a progressive and complete control of colonization was obtained. © 2017 by the authors.

Unfortunately, present project organisations do not foster proactive approaches to preventing costly production waste derived from communication problems. To address this, the effective exchange of information needs to be performed across all different parties, as the construction project commonly includes concurrent progresses along its supply chain. This article proposes a new concept that integrates feed-forward control with the principle of network science. Referred to as supply-chain information network, it aims to comprehend the correlations within a sequenced supply chain network, in order to identify the critical communication links supporting a preventive control. Its effectiveness was verified by applying the model to an actual case: the rebar supply chain from a multi-story building in Sydney, NSW, Australia. The analysis recognised four problematical players in the supply chain: (1) rebar factory linemen, (2) radio crew, (3) senior steel fixers and (4) steel fixers, based on four centrality measurements. Consequently, the experimental data confirm the hypothesis that proactive management of the supply chain will produce drastic improvements, achieving up to 23.3% reduction in waste time during placement. The relevance of this research lies in the operational introduction of network science to the construction supply chain, and its proactive culture resulted in significant improvements of process performance. In addition, the developed communication backbone suggests an actualised test bed of concurrent information exchanges that tried to escape the spatiotemporal limitation in a chained attribute in the construction industry. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","communication; experimental research; information technology; network science; process waste; radio frequency identification; supply chain","Communication; Construction industry; Information services; Information technology; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Waste management; Amount of information; Communication problems; Construction projects; Construction supply chain; Exchange of information; Experimental research; Network science; Process wastes; Supply chains",,"Moon, S.; Swinburne University of Technology, Australia; email: sungkon.moon@gmail.com","SAGE Publications Ltd",1063293X,,CRAPE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019758481

The paper uses empirical research on cargo movement in Northern Europe to reveal the frictions resulting from freight cargo’s spatial ordering and from systemic imbalances in trade flows. It shows the multiple lines of friction produced by and productive of cargo mobilities across maritime and terrestrial space. It argues that logistics is an art of accommodating this and creating competitive advantage through making interruptions, discontinuities or seams in the spaces of flow. This is done through different temporal logics of ordering physical cargo sequenced across maritime and terrestrial space. The paper further shows the frictions between the physical spaces and flows of freight and the corresponding code-space and data flows. Bespoke corporate systems translate freight cargo to data and provide visibility to actors such that logistical and regulatory work can be anticipated and planned. Yet they do so through specific lines of sight. Bespoke systems also create seam spaces between networks as they simultaneously make frictions between rival corporate systems. The effect is to generate a contested, fractured space in which at stake is whether logistics works to further the interests of lead actors in the distribution chain linking up the global factory or as a tool of supply chain capitalism that spans continents and connects material supply to consumer, in which logistical actors increasingly perform the role of contractors in a global warehouse. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Cargo mobilities; distribution; logistics; seam space; storage; supply chain capitalism","capitalism; cargo handling; freight transport; maritime transportation; storage; supply chain management; trade flow; Northern Europe","ESRC: ES/L003066/1","Gregson, N.; Department of Geography, Lower Mountjoy, South Road, United Kingdom; email: nicky.gregson@durham.ac.uk","SAGE Publications Ltd",02637758,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019598997

So that providing high quality raw material is considered as a basic requirement for a manufacturer to produce popular products, as well as achieve more market shares. On the other hand, considering the existence of competitive environment, suppliers have to offer customers incentives like discounts and enhance the quality of their products in a competition with other manufacturers. Therefore, in this study, a model is presented for CLSC optimization, efficient supplier selection, as well as orders allocation considering quantity discount policy. It is modeled using multi-objective programming based on the integrated simultaneous data envelopment analysis–Nash bargaining game. In this study, maximizing profit and efficiency and minimizing defective and functions of delivery delay rate are taken into accounts. Beside supplier selection, the suggested model selects refurbishing sites, as well as determining the number of products and parts in each network’s sector.

In order to achieve a balance between supply and demand in the power grid, storage technologies are required, both short-term as well as long-term. The bidirectional link of the existing natural gas infrastructure with the power grid is enabled by the transformation of electric power in water electrolysis in a gaseous chemical energy carrier, hydrogen. Hydrogen can be admixed to the natural gas infrastructure (pipelines, gas reservoirs) in a limited amount, or can react with carbon dioxide and/or carbon monoxide in a catalytic reaction to methane. With the utilization of the natural gas infrastructure a release of the power grid as well as long-term energy storage are achieved. Another advantage of this “Power-to-Gas” technology is the use of CO2 emissions for the production of methane, and thus the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by CO2-recycling and the substitution of fossil sources. The actual research in the field of ”Power-to-Gas” deals with technological progress both in electrolysis as well as methanation, particularly to decrease investment costs. In terms of methanation, load flexible processes have to be developed which are adjusted to the fluctuating hydrogen production. The economic viability of the Power-to-Gas process chain can be increased by a synergetic link to existing industrial production. For example, an integrated steel plant offers a promising infrastructure, since carbon containing process gases are available in huge amounts, and oxygen as byproduct of the water electrolysis can be used directly. Such concepts facilitate an economically advantageous application of the Power-to-Gas technology in near future. © 2017, The Author(s).","methanation; Power-to-Gas; renewable energy; storage","Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Catalysis; Economics; Electrolysis; Energy storage; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Hydrogenation; Investments; Methanation; Methane; Natural gas; Renewable energy resources; Steelmaking; Bi-directional links; Catalytic reactions; Economic viability; Industrial production; Natural gas infrastructure; Renewable energies; Storage technology; Technological progress; Electric power transmission networks",,"Lehner, M.; Lehrstuhl für Verfahrenstechnik des industriellen Umweltschutzes, Franz Josef-Straße 18, Austria; email: markus.lehner@unileoben.ac.at","Springer-Verlag Wien",0932383X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019031453

This network involves multiple entities that cooperate to meet customers demand and control network inventory. Although there is a large body of research on measurement of chaos in the supply chain, no proper method has been proposed to control its chaotic behavior. Moreover, the dynamic equations used in the supply chain ignore many factors that affect this chaotic behavior. This paper offers a more comprehensive modeling, analysis, and control of chaotic behavior in the supply chain. A supply chain network with a centralized decision-making structure is modeled. This model has a control center that determines the order of entities and controls their inventories based on customer demand. There is a time-varying delay in the supply chain network, which is equal to the maximum delay between entities. Robust control method with linear matrix inequality technique is used to control the chaotic behavior. Using this technique, decision parameters are determined in such a way as to stabilize network behavior. © 2016 The Operational Research Society.

Social cooperatives are experimenting with initiatives capable of responding to the emergence of new needs and changes in society in a sustainable way. Based on an analysis of the experience of various social cooperatives operating in the field of renewable energy sources, tourism, and the use of assets confiscated from the Mafia, this paper aims to highlight how social enterprise manages to create contexts of sustainable development, thereby building interorganizational and intersectoral collaborative networks aimed at the activation of new paths for local development. This represents evidence of the specific nature of the social enterprise, which is able to establish a number of coordination mechanisms. It creates new businesses with public and private, and profit and non-profit partners, with the aim of achieving a stated goal, or enters into contractual arrangements, in order to establish business partnerships and build entire local manufacturing supply chains.

However, effective implementation requires a systemic change across supply chains, involving both technological and nontechnological innovations. Frameworks are beginning to emerge to foster CE thinking in organizations. However, literature review carried out as part of this research has revealed gaps in their ability to fulfil CE requirements. Furthermore, few frameworks provide support on how CE requirements may be implemented. To address these issues, this article presents a new framework, BECE (backcasting and eco-design for the circular economy), to ensure that businesses can implement CE requirements more readily. BECE empowers organizations to tackle the CE holistically by embedding the concept into corporate decision making and by bringing operational and systems thinking together, thus increasing the likelihood of successful implementation. The potential of the BECE framework was tested through a pilot workshop focusing on the development of a CE business model through redesign of products and supply chains.

In this paper, the assignment problem considers the strategic and tactical decisions together, which involves the mapping of components to geographically distributed plants, the selection of logistics services between the mapped plants, and the allocation of inventories in each plant. The goal of this paper is to find the optimal assignment with the minimum total cost under the constraint of production rate. We first mathematically formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear program. Then, by deriving the properties of pipelined production in supply chain networks, we develop dynamic programming algorithms to efficiently obtain the optimal assignments. By the consideration of high degree of pipelining, our techniques can make a good tradeoff between high production rate and low operation cost. Extensive computational experiments show that the proposed algorithms can find high quality solutions, which achieve significant improvement compared with the initiative approaches. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agile manufacturing; Assignment algorithms; Optimization; Supply chain network","Combinatorial optimization; Communication channels (information theory); Costs; Integer programming; Manufacture; Modular construction; Operating costs; Optimization; Supply chains; Agile manufacturing; Assignment algorithms; Computational experiment; Dynamic programming algorithm; High production rate; High-quality solutions; Mixed integer linear program; Supply chain network; Dynamic programming","cstc2014yykfB40007; NSFC: 61472052; 2015AA015304","Zhuge, Q.email: qfzhuge@gmail.com","Elsevier Ltd",03608352,,CINDD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018366945

Since each industry has a unique set of characteristics which evidently drive the design supply chain network, a number of various models have been formulated to meet the needs of such business contexts. Even though many models have been proposed for manufacturing industry context, most of them are based on the facility location model. It tends to lead the supply chain network design model to be complicated. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to propose an alternative approach to formulate manufacturing network design problem. Features, such as multi-echelon, multi-commodity, products structure, and manufacturing process, are taken into consideration as characteristics of the studied environment. Moreover, uncertainty factors are also integrated to the model by employing possibilistic theory. Eventually in addition to the methodology, a case study in a consumer product firm is used to demonstrate applicability of the proposed method. Two models, deterministic and fuzzy models, have been explored in the study and both of them have demonstrated the validity of the proposed formulation method. Moreover, it is shown that the fuzzy model has outperformed its deterministic counterpart in term of cost effectiveness. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Case study; Fuzzy programming; Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP); Network flow; Optimization; Strategic supply chain planning; Supply chain network design; Uncertainty","Consumer products; Cost effectiveness; Facilities; Industrial research; Integer programming; Location; Manufacture; Optimization; Fuzzy programming; Mixed-integer linear programming; Network flows; Strategic supply chain planning; Supply chain network design; Uncertainty; Supply chains",,"Yenradee, P.email: pisal@siit.tu.ac.th","Elsevier Ltd",03608352,,CINDD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018338809

Unfortunately, guidelines supporting comprehensive analysis, especially concerning the evaluation of environmental and social performance of decision alternatives, are missing. This hinders the advancements in corporate sustainability. Questions arise on how to measure and balance respective indicators with traditional economic objectives. To fill this void, this research sets out to develop an intuitive and holistic planning framework for advancing sustainability along supply chains. In a first step, we identify sustainability issues and indicators as well as decision-support methods by scrutinizing literature on sustainable supply chain management. Based on this, we develop a planning framework that supports executives in evaluating and deciding upon corporate sustainability initiatives. The framework comprises three consecutive phases of planning: ‘Problem definition’, ‘Assessment of alternatives’, and ‘Decision analysis’. For each phase we propose appropriate tools distinguishing concepts of sustainable supply chain management (e.g. Sustainable Logistics and Sustainable Manufacturing), methods for measuring the ecological and social efficiency of decision alternatives, and quantitative decision-support techniques able to balance trade-offs between the three dimensions of the triple bottom line. As a result, this article presents a framework for guiding corporate decision-processes.

Due to the high potential threat to local infrastructure, such as buildings, roads and power supplies, heavy precipitation can have an important social and economic impact on society. At present, satellite derived precipitation estimates are becoming more readily available. This paper aims to investigate the potential use of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Multi-Sensor Precipitation Estimate (MPE) for extreme rainfall assessment in Tunisia. The MSGMPE data combine microwave rain rate estimations with SEVIRI thermal infrared channel data, using an EUMETSAT production chain in near real time mode. The MPE data can therefore be used in a now-casting mode, and are potentially useful for extreme weather early warning and monitoring. Daily precipitation observed across an in situ gauge network in the north of Tunisia were used during the period 2007–2009 for validation of the MPE extreme event data. As a first test of the MSGMPE product's performance, very light to moderate rainfall classes, occurring between January and October 2007, were evaluated. Extreme rainfall events were then selected, using a threshold criterion for large rainfall depth (>50 mm/day) occurring at least at one ground station. Spatial interpolation methods were applied to generate rainfall maps for the drier summer season (from May to October) and the wet winter season (from November to April). Interpolated gauge rainfall maps were then compared to MSGMPE data available from the EUMETSAT UMARF archive or from the GEONETCast direct dissemination system. The summation of the MPE data at 5 and/or 15 min time intervals over a 24 h period, provided a basis for comparison. The MSGMPE product was not very effective in the detection of very light and light rain events. Better results were obtained for the slightly more moderate and moderate rain event classes in terms of percentage of detected events, correlation coefficient, and ratio bias. The results for extreme events were mixed, with high pixel correlations of R=0.75 achieved for some events, while for other events the correlation between satellite and ground observation was rather weak. MPE data for northern Tunisia seem more reliable during the summer season and for larger event scales. The MSGMPE data have demonstrated to be very informative for early warning purposes, but need to be combined with other near real time data or information to give reliable and quantitative estimates of extreme rainfall. © 2017 CERN for the benefit of the ALICE collaboration","Extremes; Meteosat; Rainfall; Tunisia; Validation","economic impact; environmental assessment; environmental monitoring; extreme event; interpolation; Meteosat; model validation; pixel; quantitative analysis; rainfall; real time; risk assessment; satellite; sensor; SEVIRI; threshold; Tunisia","UTM","Dhib, S.; ENIT, BP 37 Le Belvédère 1002 TUNIS, Canada; email: dhib_saoussen@hotmail.fr","Elsevier B.V.",22120947,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017139014

A characterization of coauthorship in terms of researchers’ countries, institutions and individuals was elaborated, so three different one-mode networks were studied. Besides, the SCA research community is characterized in terms of Supply Chain Management (SCM) research streams. Coauthorship among researchers working on different streams is also analyzed. Metrics that depict the importance of the network nodes were studied such as degree, betweenness and closeness. This study found out an intense collaboration between USA and countries such as China, India, United Kingdom and Canada. Researchers from Canada and Ireland are better situated (central) in the network, although they have not published a considerable amount of papers. The presence of cliques and the small-world effect were also observed in these networks. In terms of research streams, more research on SCA located at the Strategic Management, Technology-focused and Logistics streams was found. The most common links between research streams are on the one side, Technology-focused with both Strategic Management and Logistics and on the other side Strategic Management with both Logistics and Organizational behavior. SCA researchers are rarely working with a focus on Marketing. This study contributes to the SCA literature by identifying the most central actors in this area and by characterizing the area in terms of SCM research streams. This study may contribute to the development of more focused research incentive programs and collaborations. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Big data analytics; Business analytics; Coauthorship networks; Social network analysis; Supply chain analytics",,,"Barbosa, M.W.; Department of Software Engineering and Information Systems, Av: Dom José Gaspar, 500 Coração Eucarístico, Brazil; email: mwerneck@pucminas.br","Springer Netherlands",01389130,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016458100

Such recycling system has the benefits of reducing environmental pollution, boosting the economy by creating new jobs, and generating income from trading the recyclable materials. This leads to the formation of a global reverse supply chain (GRSC) of solid waste. In this paper, we investigate the design of such a GRSC with a special emphasis on three aspects; (1) uncertainty of waste collection levels, (2) associated carbon emissions, and (3) challenges posed by the supply chain's global aspect, particularly the maritime transportation costs and currency exchange rates. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to integrate the three above-mentioned important aspects in the design of a GRSC. We have used mixed integer-linear programming method along with robust optimization to develop the model which is validated using a sample case study of e-waste management. Our results show that using a robust model by taking the complex interactions characterizing global reverse supply chain networks into account, we can create a better GRSC.

We give a continuous non-linear formulation that integrates location, allocation and inventory decisions, and includes the costs of transportation, cycle inventory, safety stock, ordering and facility opening. Then, relying on the fact that the model becomes linear when certain variables are fixed, we propose a heuristic algorithm that solves the resulting linear program and uses the solution to improve the variable estimations for the next iteration. In order to show the efficiency of the algorithm, we compare our results with those of the conic quadratic formulation of the problem.

Internet of Things (IoT's) is an emerging application area for semiconductors in which security is a prime concern. Identity or authentication of a device in the network of millions of devices in IoT's is very important. In this paper, we present Secure Split Test with functional testing capability (SSTF) scheme to mitigate the counterfeits coming out from untrusted foundries. The SSTF is suitable for low cost/low end devices. To address the identity management issue in IoT's and counterfeiting of ICs, a Physical Unclonable Function based SSTF (PUF-SSTF) is presented. PUF-SSTF is suitable for ICs targeted to use in smart phones and IoT ‘s. PUF-SSTF is a security solution to address: mitigating the counterfeit ICs coming out from untrusted foundries, identity management in IoT's and licensing the device features, which will benefit the fabless semiconductor vendors for licensing and entitlement management. The proposed SSTF and PUF-SSTF techniques are implemented in both ASIC and FPGA and security analysis is performed. The security analysis results are in par with earlier secure split test techniques like Connecticut Secure Split Test (CSST).

Fishing activity, in turn, is determined by the interaction of fish availability, fishing capacity, fishing costs and global markets for tuna products. In the face of overfishing, the continued sustainable supply of tuna is likely to require improved global governance, that would benefit from modeling frameworks capable of integrating market forces with the availability of fish in order to consider alternative future projections. Here we describe such a modeling framework, in which we develop several simple, contrasting scenarios for the development of the tuna supply chain in order to illustrate the utility of the approach for global evaluation of management strategies for tuna and other complex, stock-structured fisheries. The model includes multiple national and multi-national fishing fleets, canneries and fresh/frozen markets, and connects these to global consumers using a network of flows. The model is calibrated using recent data on fish catch, cannery and fresh/frozen production, and consumption. Scenarios explore the control on future outcomes in the global tuna fishery by representing, in a simple way, the effects of (1) climate change, (2) changes in the global demand for tuna, and (3) changes in the access to fishing grounds (marine reserves). The results emphasize the potential importance of increasing demand in provoking a global collapse, and suggest that controlling tuna production by limiting technical efficiency is a potential countermeasure. Finally we discuss the outcomes in terms of potential extensions of the scenario approach allowed by this global network model of the tuna supply chain. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Global supply chain; Marine protected area; Scenarios; Tuna","Commerce; Complex networks; Conservation; Fish; Fisheries; International trade; Supply chains; Fishing activities; Future projections; Global supply chain; Management strategies; Marine protected area; Scenarios; Technical efficiency; Tuna; Climate change; abundance; calibration; climate change; conceptual framework; fishing effort; food market; marine park; overfishing; perciform; stock assessment; supply chain management; sustainability; Scombridae","ANR: ANR-08-STRA-03","Mullon, C.; IRD, Avenue Jean Monnet, France; email: christian.mullon@ird.fr","Elsevier Ltd",09670645,,DSROE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994819649

One of the most important RFID applications is tag identification, which is a process executed in an RFID network in order to distinguish the corresponding associated objects. Most of the research in this direction is aimed to the design of efficient communication protocols, which identify the whole set of tags in the covering region of an RFID reader. The common scenario comprises one reader and a set of tags, where the reader is generally located at the center of the interrogation zone; this scenario has been studied in several different ways with a centralized paradigm. However, there is a recent interest on analyzing an alternative scheme that consists in splitting the interrogation zone and executing a distributed mechanism to identify the whole set of tags. To date, some of the few contributions considering distributed approaches do not take into account a practical communication model. Thus, in this work we evaluate and compare the performance of both RFID tag identification paradigms using the EPC Class-1 Generation-2 standard and propose a practical communication model for such proposals distributing the identification process. Our results show that, indeed, the performance of the EPC Class-1 Generation-2 standard may be highly improved with the adoption of a distributed mechanism if all its features are fully exploited. Hence, the improvements obtained with our distributed proposal reach a gain of up to 65 % on the total identification delay compared with its centralized counterpart. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Distributed RFID; EPC Class-1 Generation-2; RFID tag identification","Information theory; Supply chain management; Communication modeling; Distributed approaches; Distributed identification; Efficient communications; EPC Class-1 Generation-2; Identification process; RF-ID tags; Tag identification; Radio frequency identification (RFID)","CONACYT","Sanchez, L.; UAM-Azcapotzalco, Avenida San Pablo 180, Col.

Decision on amendment of facilities is generally decided based on overall cost, leaving out the efficiency of each unit. Decomposing the supply chain superstructure, efficiency analysis of the facilities (warehouses or distribution centers) that serve customers can be easily implemented. With the proposed algorithm, the selection of a facility is based on service level maximization and not just cost minimization as this analysis filters all the feasible solutions utilizing Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique. Through multiple iterations, solutions are filtered via DEA and only the efficient ones are selected leading to cost minimization. In this work, the problem of optimal supply chain networks design is addressed based on a DEA based algorithm. A Branch and Efficiency (B&E) algorithm is deployed for the solution of this problem. Based on this DEA approach, each solution (potentially installed warehouse, plant etc) is treated as a Decision Making Unit, thus is characterized by inputs and outputs. The algorithm through additional constraints named “efficiency cuts”, selects only efficient solutions providing better objective function values. The applicability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through illustrative examples. © 2016, The Author(s).","Branch and bound; DEA; Integer programming; Mixed integer linear programming (MILP); Supply chain management",,"ESF","Emrouznejad, A.; Operations and Information Management Group, United Kingdom; email: a.emrouznejad@aston.ac.uk","Springer New York LLC",02545330,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982790304

However, their specific situation is often characterized by a lack of equity and limited access to capital markets, so that bank loans must then be used to initiate production and distribution. Within a short-term multi-day planning horizon, both operations and finance must be scheduled precisely in order to obtain practical instructions for each network partner and the network managers. For this purpose, continuous-time modeling is required. Additionally, a coordination of monetary consequences resulting from both site-specific operational events and network-wide financial transactions is necessary to prevent insolvency. As bank overdrafts can be used to overcome financial imbalances during short periods (e.g., days or even hours), appropriate time intervals for liquidity management should be determined. The implementation of these intervals requires discrete-time modeling. In this context, the main challenge is to combine both of the aforementioned modeling techniques within a common decision model. To address this problem, a novel mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) is developed, which enables exact planning and scheduling of SC operations as well as related financial transactions on the one hand, and periodic liquidity balancing on the other hand. A numerical analysis was based on a test scenario with randomly generated data. As we found out that even small problem instances of the MINLP, e.g., a three-stage supply chain with three sites in each stage, were not computable with high-performance hardware and a commercial nonlinear standard solver, we additionally propose an equivalent linearized version of the decision model. The latter could be optimized within acceptable computation time using the CPLEX solver. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Continuous-time modeling; Financing; Liquidity balancing; Short-term planning and scheduling; Supply chain networks","Finance; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Planning; Scheduling; Supply chains; Continuous time modeling; Financing; High-performance hardware; Mixed integer nonlinear program; Short term planning; Small and medium-sized companies; Supply chain network; Three-stage supply chain; Continuous time systems",,"Steinrücke, M.; Faculty of Law and Economics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Str. 70, Germany; email: martin.steinruecke@uni-greifswald.de","Springer New York LLC",10946136,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978173382

The proposed approach is composed of four main steps: (i) SC modelling to identify all stakeholders and their inter-relations, (ii) data sharing to collect all relevant data, (iii) data elaboration to calculate performance at different levels of detail and (iv) result interpretation to optimise the SC. The distributed implementation of the approach at different SC steps represents a useful means to practically realise a sustainable SC management.

The network includes all entities and their connections from oil wells to product depots. Furthermore, a real world example is applied to show the improved model application. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis in which ±20% deviations at a time were placed on two parameters is presented. Also, model performance is analyzed with GAMS 22.6. The proposed multiperiod and multiproduct model consists of several decisions (i.e., oil field development, transformation, transportation, and distribution). The main contributions of this work are inclusion of all entities related to upstream and midstream segments and both oil field development and transformation planning, simultaneously. Finally, it is shown that a decrease in production cost of refinery products will lead to more net profit given all refinery production capacity are used. Also, increase in refinery production capacity will improve network net profit given new fixed cost investment is not applied (e.g., refineries and transportation modes). This is the first study that simultaneously considers and optimizes upstream and midstream of crude oil supply chain. Second, it presents a unique mathematical model.

Using these models we analyse the influence of network externality on the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) of the retailers’ marketing objectives, the wholesale pricing of the manufacturer, and the profits of nodal enterprises. The results show that the strength of network externality affects the decisions of the manufacturer with regard to wholesale pricing, thereby influencing the evolution of the marketing objectives of retailers. When the strength of network externality is found to be low, the manufacturer is supposed to set a high wholesale price to prompt retailers to take a profit maximisation strategy (P strategy). When the strength of network externality is moderate, a moderate wholesale price would be set by the manufacturer. Under this condition, the marketing objective of retailers is evolved to stable co-existence of profit, and revenue, maximisation. While when network externality exhibits a high strength, the manufacturer is expected to set a low wholesale price and therefore retailers change the marketing objective to revenue maximisation strategy (R strategy). When the market position of retailers is low, increasing network externality cannot generate more profits. On the contrary, affected by the decisions of the manufacturer with regards to wholesale pricing, retailers lose more profits, while the profit of the manufacturer increases. With the improvement of the bargaining power of retailers, the wholesale price and profit of the manufacturer decrease; however, a large network externality can make up a part of the profit losses of the manufacturer caused by the improved bargaining power of retailers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Evolutionary stable strategy; Network externality; Profit maximisation; Revenue maximisation; Supply chain management","Commerce; Costs; Manufacture; Marketing; Profitability; Sales; Supply chain management; Decision modeling; Evolutionary game models; Evolutionary stable strategies; Marketing objective; Network externality; Strategic choice; Whole sale prices; Wholesale pricing; Economics","NSFC: 71571086; 2014A030313391","Yi, Y.; School of Management, 601 Huangpu Avenue West, China; email: yiyuyin2001@sina.com","Elsevier B.V.",03772217,,EJORD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994519302

We argue that quality in the food sector, as it is being asserted at the present time, is closely linked to nature and the local embeddedness of supply chains. We thus outline the broad contours of this shift and discuss the most appropriate theoretical approaches. We consider political economy, actor-network theory, and conventions theory and argue that, whereas political economy has proved useful in the analysis of globalization, it may prove less so in the examination of quality. We concentrate, therefore, upon actor-network theory and conventions theory and show that the former allows nature to be brought to the center of analytical attention but provides few tools for the analysis of quality, especially in the context of the food sector. Conventions theory, on the other hand, links together a range of aspects found in food supply chains and allows us to consider the establishment of quality as a system of negotiation between specific qualities.

Unlike conventional CRT where the end-to-end data rate is usually maximised without taking into account the energy consumption at the source and relay, in this study, the energy consumption is characterised by means of energy efficiency, defined as the achievable data rate per Joule. In particular, the energy states at each node (either at a SU or a relay) is modelled as a finite-state Markov chain and the transmit power at a node is optimally allocated by jointly accounting for the interference threshold prescribed by primary users (PUs), the maximum allowable transmit power and the harvested energy at the node. To maximise the energy efficiency, a best relay selection criterion is proposed and the subsequent optimal transmit power allocation is initially formulated as a non-linear fractional programming problem and, then, equivalently transformed into a parametric programming problem and, finally, solved analytically by using the classic Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. With extensive Monte-Carlo simulation results, the effectiveness of the proposed relay selection algorithm and corresponding optimal power allocation strategy are corroborated. © 2017 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Energy harvesting; Energy utilization; Intelligent systems; Linear programming; Markov processes; Mathematical programming; Monte Carlo methods; Best-relay selections; Karush Kuhn tucker condition; Optimal power allocation; Parametric programming; Relay selection; Relaying transmissions; Secondary users; Transmit power allocation; Energy efficiency","NSFC: 61403089, 61671488; 2014J4100142, 2014J4100233, 201604010073; 2013B010402018, 2013B020200016, 2016A050503025","Tang, D.; School of Mechanical and Electric Engineering, China; email: tangdong@gzhu.edu.cn","Institution of Engineering and Technology",17518628,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019846458

Recycling, reuse, and re-processing of products are activities of RL networks, all of which are becoming increasingly prevalent due to growing environmental and socio-economic concerns. Research has begun to study such networks in an effort to maximize efficiency and to improve operations. Previous work focused on developing a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) with an aim of determining the optimal location and capacity of important nodes of the RL network, such as inspection centers and remanufacturing facilities. Transportation decisions, such as whether to use in-house or outsourced vehicles, are often based on cost effectiveness. The problem is formulated for the case of a household appliance in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Sixty-eight cities are considered, leading to a very large number of variables and constraints; thus, a heuristic approach, namely a Genetic Algorithm (GA), is chosen to solve the problem. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a very efficient GA capable of solving a large scale problem in short time. The developed GA was capable of solving a very large problem (with 656,885 continuous variables, 2040 binary variables, 10 integer variables, and 100,340 constraints) with a gap of 0.3% and about 38.5 times faster than GAMS using a personal computer. The same GA succeeded to solve both large and small problems to optimality or with a gap that didn't exceed 1.5% and faster than GAMS.

This paper investigates the possibility of closing the chain in a textile company and the effects of such a decision on the profits of the chain. The paper addresses one of the common problems in modelling the return rates of backward chain. Since inaccuracy in estimation of such rates leads to incorrect results, the present model forgoes the need for commonly used predetermined rates by proposing a conditional quality-based segmentation policy. Addition of a secondary chain as a recovery option, quality-dependent incentive rates and flexibility of the model in defining quality, are also among novel points of this paper. First, a bi-objective model is proposed to formulate the chain which includes the manufacturers, distributors and customers in the forward chain and remanufacturing, repairing and recycling centers in the backward chain. This model is applicable to industries with zero-waste strategy and similar recovery facilities. Second, an extensive sensitivity analysis is carried out on a case-study from textile industry. The results reveal that increase in rate of returns with low/medium qualities leads to higher profits since they create more suitable environmental/economical business opportunities. Moreover, closing the supply chain of the company increases the impact of distributors/collectors’ performance on the final profits. Hence, managers of the company need to adopt a pricing policy in favor of the distributors/collectors, which equals to lower repairing, remanufacturing and purchase costs from manufacturers, and higher sales prices to customers, manufacturers and recycling center. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Closed-loop supply chain; Mixed integer programming; Quality of returns; Returns management","Costs; Earnings; Integer programming; Linear matrix inequalities; Manufacture; Profitability; Recycling; Repair; Sales; Secondary recovery; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Textile industry; Textiles; Biobjective model; Business opportunities; Closed-loop supply chain; Mixed integer programming; Pricing policy; Purchase cost; Rate of return; Returns managements; Plant shutdowns",,"Sahraeian, R.; College of Engineering, Iran; email: sahraeian@shahed.ac.ir","Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016499835

The paper also addresses five reconfigurability dimensions in the perspective of supply chains and the major enablers to attain them. The paper further aims to understand the mutual interactions among these enablers through the identification of hierarchical relationships among them. Design/methodology/approach: A framework that holistically considers all the major enablers of reconfigurability has been developed. The hierarchical interrelationships between major enablers have been presented and interpreted using a novel qualitative modeling technique, i.e., total interpretive structural modeling (TISM), which is an extension of ISM. SPSS 22.0 is employed to carry out a one-tailed one-sample t-test further to test the hypotheses for validating the results of TISM. Impact matrix cross-reference multiplication applied to a classification (MICMAC) analysis has been employed to identify the driving and dependence powers of these reconfigurability enablers. Findings: In this paper, 15 enablers for reconfigurability paradigm have been identified through literature review and expert opinions. The authors established interrelationships and interdependencies among these enablers and categorized them as enablers of each dimension. New product development and customer satisfaction come at the highest level of priority. The levels of these enablers were obtained using TISM. The authors compared the results with the clusters derived from MICMAC analysis, and the results are found to be well within the acceptable range. Research limitations/implications: The study has implications for both practitioners and academia. The work provides a comprehensive list of enablers that are relevant to reconfigure supply chains in today’s volatile global market. This research will also help decision makers to strategically focus on the top-level enablers and their concerned dimensions. The research is based on an automobile company case study and can be extended to products with volatile and changing demands. Originality/value: The proposed model for reconfigurability enablers using TISM is a new effort altogether in the area of supply chain management. The novelty of this research lies in its identification of specific enablers to reconfigure a supply chain through different dimensions. © 2017, 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Impact matrix cross-reference multiplication applied to a classification (MICMAC) analysis; Reconfigurability; SPSS 22.0; Supply chain network; Total interpretive structural modeling (TISM)",,,"Biswas, P.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, India; email: pallab.biswas@gmail.com","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09727981,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059570447

To evaluate cross-enterprise value streams of manufacturing, business or service processes in detail, a holistic methodology is needed. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: In this research paper, the assessment of value streams within complex cross-company networks is described. After a presentation of relevant KPIs in the fields of value stream management (VSM) and supply chain management (SCM), an approach for a cross-enterprise evaluation of value streams on different levels of detail is shown. In addition, the use of an absolute VSM evaluation, in contrast to a relative VSM assessment, is examined. Findings: Based on a uniform and well-balanced set of KPIs and other VSM and SCM parameters, a performance assessment on different levels of value stream detail is enabled. Further investigations reveal the advantages of a relative compared with an absolute VSM assessment. Research limitations/implications: In addition to a comprehensive overview of existing KPIs for a value stream assessment beyond company borders, a holistic and multi-level VSM approach is presented in this paper. In contrast to existing VSM approaches, the described method allows an evaluation and subsequent improvement of value streams within supply chain networks. Up to now, the presented approach for the assessment of cross-enterprise value streams has only been tested in specific industrial environments. In future, the proposed methodology shall also be validated for other process types like business, service or further manufacturing processes. Practical implications: The described cross-company performance measurement approach shows a high practical relevance for organizations operating in supply chain networks. Due to the integrated use of different VSM parameters, the evaluation of highly interconnected value streams across corporate boundaries is facilitated. By means of a case study, the proposed methodology is validated under real industry conditions and proves its practical applicability. Originality/value: One of the novel features of this research is the extension of the traditional VSM method with respect to a relative evaluation of value streams based on a set of significant KPIs. In addition, the allocation of these KPIs to different value stream layers and categories leads to an innovative approach for a multi-level assessment according to the needs of the specific VSM application, e.g. a more standardized use of VSM in complex supply chain networks. © 2017, 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Industrial engineering; Key performance indicators; Lean manufacturing; Performance measurement; Production planning; Value stream mapping",,,"Oberhausen, C.; Faculte des Sciences, Luxembourg; email: christof.oberhausen@uni.lu","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09727981,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045255643

Stick-pack technology is employed for pre-storage and release of liquid reagents. Quantitative layout of centrifugo-pneumatic particle handling, including timed valving, switching and pumping is assisted by network simulations. The automation is exclusively controlled by the spinning frequency and does not require any additional means. New centrifugal microfluidic process chains are developed in order to sequentially supply wash buffer based on frequency dependent stick-pack opening and pneumatic pumping to perform two washing steps from one stored wash buffer; pre-store and re-suspend functionalized microparticles on a disk; and switch between the path of the waste fluid and the path of the substrate reaction product with 100% efficiency. The automated immunoassay concept is composed of on demand ligand binding, two washing steps, the substrate reaction, timed separation of the reaction products, and termination of the substrate reaction. We demonstrated separation of particles from three different liquids with particle loss below 4% and residual liquid remaining within particles below 3%.

To the best of our knowledge, integration of green supplier evaluation into the designing supply chain network with reverse logistics has not been considered in the literature. This integration can help to incorporate experts’ opinions about environmental impact of suppliers in the network design. Minimization of total cost and maximization of total greenness score of purchased raw materials/components are two objectives of the model. The fuzzy EDAS method is used to determine the greenness scores of suppliers. Also, demand of customers and capacity of suppliers are defined using fuzzy numbers and a fuzzy method is used to obtain trade-off solutions.

This paper explores the use of an optimisation model of Thailand’s rubber industry supply chain, to assess the impact of distribution and transportation on costs and greenhouse gas emissions. It has previously been observed that there is a positive correlation between transportation cost reduction and environmental impact, nevertheless the correlation is not clearly established when the distribution system is restructured. This paper is divided into two parts: the first part examines the impact of transportation service capacity on distribution decisions; the second part of the paper aims to examine the impact of restructuring the distribution network considering multi-modal options on cost and greenhouse gas emissions. For both parts a scenario analysis is utilised in conjunction with an optimisation model to derive the best possible answer in terms of costs and GHG emissions. In this paper, the results obtained indicate that the impact on cost minimisation from the increase in rail freight service capacity is marginal, while the impact on GHG emission minimisation is more significant. In terms of short-sea shipping prices and service capacity, the scenario analysis shows a slight positive impact on cost minimisation but no positive or negative impact on GHG emission minimisation. Results also confirm that in terms of economic advantages, distribution network restructuring provides greater benefit to the industry than does capacity development for the transportation service. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","distribution network; greenhouse gas emissions; restructuring; the Thai rubber supply chain; Transportation network",,,"Chanchaichujit, J.; School of Information Systems, Australia; email: janya.chanchaichujit@curtin.edu.au","Taylor and Francis Ltd.",13675567,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982306501

Despite the large supply chain management literature on green performance measurement, the need for a systematic analysis of how specific sustainable variables develop and affect each other remains mostly overlooked. The proposed integrated framework allows for such an analysis. By combining analytic network process and quality function deployment, our model identifies a clear hierarchical structure for all the relevant sustainable factors and sub-factors while weighting the decision criteria based on the importance given to customer requirements. Finally, suppliers are ranked using a multi-objective optimisation procedure based on ratio analysis and weighted aggregated sum product assessment. The proposed framework is used to analyse a case study of a dairy company, but it can be easily implemented for supplier selection by any other company with similar features. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","criteria interdependency; customer requirement; hierarchical structure; long-run planning; Sustainable supplier selection; technical requirement",,,"Tavana, M.; Business Systems and Analytics, United States; email: tavana@lasalle.edu","Taylor and Francis Ltd.",13675567,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981745096

This will lead to the flexible usage of different globally distributed, scalable and sustainable, service-oriented manufacturing systems and resources. Combining recently emerged technologies, such as Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Semantic Web, service-oriented technologies, virtualisation and advanced high-performance computing technologies, with advanced manufacturing models and information technologies, Cloud Manufacturing is a new manufacturing paradigm built on resource sharing, supporting and driving this change. It is envisioned that companies in all sectors of manufacturing will be able to package their resources and know-hows in the Cloud, making them conveniently available for others through pay-as-you-go, which is also timely and economically attractive. Resources, e.g. manufacturing software tools, applications, knowledge and fabrication capabilities and equipment, will then be made accessible to presumptive consumers on a worldwide basis. Cloud Manufacturing has been in focus for a great deal of research interest and suggested applications during recent years, by both industrial and academic communities. After surveying a vast array of available publications, this paper presents an up-to-date literature review together with identified outstanding research issues, and future trends and directions within Cloud Manufacturing. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cloud manufacturing; resource sharing; service-orientation","Application programs; Computer aided manufacturing; Distributed computer systems; Manufacture; Supply chains; Cloud Manufacturing; Global Manufacturing Networks; High-performance computing technology; Manufacturing industries; Manufacturing software; Resource sharing; Service orientation; Service-oriented manufacturing systems; Industrial research",,"Adamson, G.; Virtual Systems Research Centre, Sweden; email: goran.adamson@his.se","Taylor and Francis Ltd.",0951192X,,ICIME,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927720769

This system consists of open, modular and shared containers and transit hubs to move goods globally. The purpose of this paper is to compare the performance of PI with regard to the conventional (CO) logistics system in order to quantify the advantages and disadvantages of PI from a truck and driver routing perspective with an explicit constraint on maximum return time for drivers. The comparison presented in this work is carried out through Monte-Carlo simulation within a sequential three-phase optimisation framework. Based on our analysis, PI reduces driving distance (and time), GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions and the social cost of truck driving. On the other hand, it increases the number of container transfers within the PI logistics centres. This insight is a contribution of the paper and reinforces the current literature on PI. The other main contribution of the paper is a validation of the claim that the number of drivers who can go back home at the end of a work day remains consistently high in PI, regardless of the traffic level. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","logistics; logistics network optimisation; optimisation; Physical Internet; routing; supply chain management; transportation","Containers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Network routing; Supply chain management; Transportation; Trucks; Driving distance; Innovative logistics; Logistic systems; Logistics centres; Logistics network; Logistics system; Optimisations; routing; Logistics",,"Venkatadri, U.; Department of Industrial Engineering, Canada; email: Uday.Venkatadri@dal.ca","Taylor and Francis Ltd.",00207543,,IJPRB,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013374282

Once the network has been defined, the storage and distribution of goods are usually fixed and restricted within the network. This is assumed to be an inherent limit of current inventory control research. Instead of specialised hierarchical storage networks, this paper proposes an innovative vendor-managed inventory strategy exploiting the Physical Internet (PI), which is an open, universal, interconnected logistics system. In such a system, facilities and means of transport are shared and can be allocated according to demands of users. As a result, the PI allows users to stock anywhere in the network and also provides open multisourcing options for orders with on-demand warehousing services within the PI. Inventory decisions can be made dynamically by each player to minimise networkwide inventory levels. A non-linear, simulation-based optimisation model was developed for the vendors’ inventory decision-making when confronted with stochastic demands. A metaheuristic using simulated annealing was applied to solve the problem, and then, the optimised inventory decisions were validated using simulation. The results suggest that the proposed PI inventory model can reduce the total logistics cost while maintaining a comparable or better level of end customers’ services. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","decentralised inventory; inventory control; Physical Internet; simulation-based optimisation; vendor-managed inventory","Decision making; Inventory control; Logistics; Optimization; Simulated annealing; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Decentralised; Hierarchical storage; Inventory decisions; Simulation based optimisation; Supply chain network; Total logistics costs; Vendor managed Inventory; Warehousing services; Distribution of goods",,"Ballot, E.; MINES ParisTech, France; email: eric.ballot@mines-paristech.fr","Taylor and Francis Ltd.",00207543,,IJPRB,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007495100

Although some global corporations are using their own production networks across continents, they are not similar to the original idea of non-hierarchical production networks in many aspects. It seems that this idea waited for production systems to acquire proper information and communications technology (ICT) or new industrial platforms, like Industry 4.0. The result is a new type of production network called Cyber-Physical Production Network (CPPN). The CPPN is, from ICT point of view, ready to act as non-hierarchical production networks consisting of autonomous production systems with many automated processes. One of the most important processes of the CPPN is a selection of optimal partners (enterprises) to be part of a new virtual enterprise, created inside production network. An optimisation problem emerges in this process, and it is called Partner Selection Problem (PSP). It is non-polynomial-hard combinatorial problem. Since metaheuristic algorithms are well-proven in solving that kind of problem, a specially designed metaheuristic algorithm derived from ant colony optimisation and named the HUMANT (HUManoid ANT) algorithm is used in this paper. It is multi-objective optimisation algorithm that successfully solves different instances of PSP with two, three, four or more objectives. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agile manufacturing; ant colony optimisation; cyber-physical system; HUMANT algorithm; multi-criteria decision-making; supply chain management","Ant colony optimization; Automation; Decision making; Embedded systems; Enterprise resource planning; Hierarchical systems; Multiobjective optimization; Packet networks; Problem solving; Supply chain management; Virtual corporation; Agile manufacturing; Autonomous production systems; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Information and communications technology; Meta heuristic algorithm; Multi criteria decision making; Optimisation problems; Partner selection problem (PSP); Optimization",,"Mladineo, M.; Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Croatia; email: marko.mladineo@fesb.hr","Taylor and Francis Ltd.",00207543,,IJPRB,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987916043

The key elements are the encapsulation and the handling of world-standard smart green modular containers (π-containers) throughout an open global logistic infrastructure. Logistic processes such as partial loading/unloading or splitting/merging of π-containers play an important role for a successful Physical Internet. However, the large variety of transformation processes can introduce desynchronisation between the physical and informational flows, i.e. the real composition of a composite π-container (a set of stacked π-containers) can differ of the information stored in the supply chain management system. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a system to generate and maintain automatically a virtual three-dimensional layout reflecting the spatial distribution of π-containers. The proposed approach uses smart π-containers equipped with wireless sensor nodes. The relative position of π-containers can be determined by the neighbourhood relationships between the sensor nodes. From this information, a constraint set is formulated in a Constraint Satisfaction Problem where each solution is a potential loading pattern. The methodology is developed and computational experiments are proposed, as a proof-of-concept.

In this paper, Huan Jing (HJ) satellite HJ1A/B and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were employed to retrieve leaf area index (LAI) and canopy cover (CC) in the Yangling area (Central China). These variables were then assimilated into two crop models, Aquacrop and simple algorithm for yield (SAFY), in order to compare their performances and practicalities. Due to the models' specificities and computational constraints, different assimilation methods were used. For SAFY, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) was applied using LAI as the observed variable, while for Aquacrop, particle swarm optimization (PSO) was used, using canopy cover (CC). These techniques were applied and validated both at the field and at the district scale. In the field application, the lowest relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) value of 18% was obtained using EnKF with SAFY. On a district scale, both methods were able to provide production estimates in agreement with data provided by the official statistical offices. From an operational point of view, SAFY with the EnKF method was more suitable than Aquacrop with PSO, in a data assimilation context. © 2017 by the authors.","Artificial neural network (ANN); Canopy cover (CC); Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF); HJ1A/B; Landsat 8; Leaf area index (LAI); Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Kalman filters; Mean square error; Neural networks; Optimization; Supply chain management; Canopy cover; Ensemble Kalman Filter; HJ1A/B; LANDSAT; Leaf Area Index; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",,"Casa, R.; DAFNE, Via San Camillo de Lellis, Italy; email: rcasa@unitus.it","MDPI AG",20724292,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019892562

To help combat hardware security vulnerabilities, a wide range of security primitives have emerged in recent years. A popular example is physical unclonable functions (PUFs) that leverage process variations to provide unique signatures or fingerprints that can be used for authentication or secret key generation. Nanoelectronic technologies, such as thememristor technologies considered here, provide an excellent opportunity to engineer dense, energy-efficient PUF circuits with desirable statistical properties. Here, we specifically focus on the design considerations of a memristive crossbar based PUF that generates response bits as a function of variable memristor switching time. In addition to describing the operation of the crossbar PUF, we also consider its resilience to two specific machine learning attacks, specifically through the use of linear regression and support vector machines. Two circuit design modifications for the crossbar PUF are provided to improve the resilience to machine learning attacks: XORing of response bits and internal column swapping. We show that the design modifications lead to a reduction in the likelihood of successful attack to about 50% (near ideal) even given 5000 iterations for the attack itself. We also provide power estimates and performance considerations for the crossbar PUF based on three specific memristive material stacks: hafniumoxide, tantalum-oxide, and titanium-oxide. © 2017 IEEE.","Emerging nanotechnology; hardware security; machine learning attack; memristor; memristor PUF; modeling attack; physically unclonable function; PUF; ReRAM; RRAM; transition metal-oxide","Access control; Artificial intelligence; Computer hardware; Cryptography; Energy efficiency; Hardware; Integrated circuit manufacture; Learning systems; Memristors; Metals; Network security; Reverse engineering; RRAM; Security of data; Supply chains; Tantalum oxides; Titanium oxides; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Design considerations; Memristor; Nanoelectronic technologies; Physically unclonable functions; Secret key generations; Security vulnerabilities; Statistical properties; Transition-metal oxides; Hardware security",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",1536125X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019361311

Uncertainty in estimating product demand in the premarkets and spare parts demands in the after-sales markets and qualified outputs of production facilities throughout these two chains are considered in this problem. Stochastic qualified outputs of these facilities are due to their imperfect productions systems. We show that uncertainties propagate and qualified flow depreciates by moving material, components, and products from upstream to the downstream of these supply chains, and these phenomena should be quantified to determine the service levels of this company in the pre- and after-sales markets. At the end, we propose a mathematical model determining the best marketing strategies for this company (i.e., price, warranty length, and service levels) in the markets and their preserving reliable flow dynamics throughout the chains' networks.

Effective supply chain management is a critical successful factor for enterprises to survive in such a competitive market since it can help enterprises in reducing cost and improving operational efficiency. For an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) in the semiconductor industry, due to its complex network, strategic alliance among partners as well as supply chain integration are efficient approaches to enhance competitiveness and make more profit. In this paper, we develop an integrated model of supply chain planning for IDMs. The integrated model is developed to help decision makers determine the production quantities and delivery quantities at various locations, the decoupling point of a push-pull supply chain, the inventory buffer at the boundary and the vendor managed inventory scenario. The semiconductor manufacturing characteristics including binning, substitution, and yield are taken into consideration in the formulated model.

The following study develops a systemic analytical framework based on which climate risks for manufacturing industries are reviewed and drivers (defined as supportive factors) of entrepreneurial robustness are examined. The analysis builds upon a case study in the alpine Austrian state of Tyrol where an intense regional rise of average temperatures occurs, going along with increased risks of natural mountain hazards and exposed settlement structures. In this climate-sensitive setting the authors conducted a survey on risk perceptions among 102 managers from manufacturing firms. Based on a comparison of the sectors metal and engineering, timber products, and construction, the authors argue that drivers of entrepreneurial robustness can be subsumed under five major strategic principles: (a) the deployment of slack resources, (b) vertical supply chain integration, (c) manufacturing flexibility, (d) material efficiency, and (e) technological risk prevention. Departing from the empirical results, the authors argue that across these principles the development of drivers depends on an interplay of structural prerequisites and human decisions on the levels of the focal firm, the supply chain network, and the political, economic, and geographic environment. In this sense, the authors conceptualize different forms of contingencies – thus effects influencing the development of drivers – within an ontology which may support further system-oriented analysis of climate change adaptation in industry. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change adaptation; Manufacturing industries; Risk perceptions; Sectoral comparison; Supply chain risks; Vulnerability","adaptive management; alpine environment; analytical framework; climate change; decision making; manufacturing; multinational enterprise; organizational framework; questionnaire survey; risk perception; spatial cognition; supply chain management; vulnerability; Austria; Tyrol",,"Meinel, U.; Institute of Geography, Innrain 52f, Austria; email: ulrike.meinel@uibk.ac.at","Elsevier Ltd",09593780,,GECHE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016500617

CRP is a well-established supply chain collaboration program that is widely used in business. The model computes the cost savings of CRP for both partners involving inventory holding, transportation and ordering/handling cost components. The savings drivers associated with each cost component are identified and used to quantify the impact of CRP. The model is applied in a healthcare supply chain case study where a manufacturer seeks to estimate the cost savings of a business relationship with a distributor. The results indicate that CRP reduces the total cost of the supply chain by 19.1%. In this instance, the distributor gains disproportionately more savings in the shared cost components. The variability and sensitivity of cost savings across the network reveal the supply chain parameters that affect the partner savings. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Continuous replenishment program; Cost modeling; Data-driven decision making; Healthcare supply chain; Supply chain collaboration; Transportation efficiency","Costs; Decision making; Health care; Supply chains; Continuous replenishment; Cost modeling; Data driven decision; Supply chain collaboration; Transportation efficiency; Cost benefit analysis",,"Parsa, P.email: pparsa@uark.edu","Elsevier B.V.",09255273,,IJPCE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015098416

New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios. © 2017 The Authors","Agriculture; Business modelling; Data; Data infrastructure; Governance; Information and communication technology","agricultural land; agricultural modeling; artificial intelligence; conceptual framework; data acquisition; data set; decision making; food production; food supply; governance approach; literature review; power relations; stakeholder; supply chain management","H2020: 731884","Wolfert, S.; Wageningen University and Research, Hollandseweg 1, Netherlands; email: sjaak.wolfert@wur.nl","Elsevier Ltd",0308521X,,AGSYD,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011824717

Firstly, the rationality is proved by analyzing the consistency of sales and changes in various agent parameters between the simulation model and a real automobile supply chain. Second, through complex network theory, hierarchical structures of the model and relationships of networks at different levels are analyzed to calculate various characteristic parameters such as mean distance, mean clustering coefficients, and degree distributions. By doing so, it verifies that the model is a typical scale-free network and small-world network. Finally, the motion law of this model is analyzed from the perspective of complex self-adaptive systems. The chaotic state of the simulation system is verified, which suggests that this system has typical nonlinear characteristics. This model not only macroscopically illustrates the dynamic evolution of complex networks of automobile supply chain but also microcosmically reflects the business process of each agent. Moreover, the model construction and simulation of the system by means of combining CAS theory and complex networks supplies a novel method for supply chain analysis, as well as theory bases and experience for supply chain analysis of auto companies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Automobile; Complex network; Complex self-adaptive system; Empirical analysis; Hybrid modeling; Supply chain","Automobiles; Automotive industry; Complex networks; Hierarchical clustering; Small-world networks; Supply chains; Clustering coefficient; Empirical analysis; Hierarchical structures; Hybrid model; Model construction and simulation; Nonlinear characteristics; Self-adaptive system; Supply chain analysis; Adaptive systems","NSFC: 11072192, 51275407","Sun, J.-Y.; College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, China","Elsevier B.V.",03784371,,PHYAD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009469990

Many retailers have setup programs aimed at tackling it, while the food industry has also launched programs including waste reduction among their main goals. Indeed, food waste is already a crucial theme, and its importance is growing in these years. In the last decade, retailers have achieved relevant progresses in reducing the amount of food wasted in their stores as well as along distribution networks. Nevertheless, there is still room for further improvements: Better forecasting, more careful assortment and order decisions, suitable policies promoting products' freshness, and shelf life management can yield significant waste reductions. Besides, retailers can help to reduce waste along the supply chain through closer collaboration with other upstream actors. This chapter considers methods and models devoted to waste reduction in fresh food supply chain operations to be included in a Decision Support System, and presents a case study on a real supply chain dedicated to fresh and perishable packaged products, involving a set of retailers with both small and medium sized stores located in the Apulia region (Italy). Optimization is a crucial issue in such a context and the main criticalities are related to the uncertainty on future sales. This study proposes an integrated and flexible approach that accounts for the following issues: Demand forecasting, order planning and delivery optimization. The aim is to support the decision maker to determine operations plans with respect to waste reduction and other different criteria, such as shortage, freshness and residual stock of products. Results are reported and discussed enlightening both quality of forecasting and its effects on the order planning activity. The results show the potential benefits of the proposed approach to pursue the waste reduction in the distribution and the retailer supply chain and the possible extensions to contribute to the recovery of fresh food surplus. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

Consequently, the smart farm has become part of the crucial trend that is needed for application in certain farm areas. The aims of smart farm are to control and to enhance food production and productivity, and to increase farmers' profits. The advantages in applying smart farm will improve the quality of production, supporting the farm workers, and better utilization of resources. This study aims to explore the research trends and identify research clusters on smart farm using bibliometric analysis that has supported farming to improve the quality of farm production. The bibliometric analysis is the method to explore the relationship of the articles from a co-citation network of the articles and then science mapping is used to identify clusters in the relationship. This study examines the selected research articles in the smart farm field. The area of research in smart farm is categorized into two clusters that are soil carbon emission from farming activity, food security and farm management by using a VOSviewer tool with keywords related to research articles on smart farm, agriculture, supply chain, knowledge management, traceability, and product lifecycle management from Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus online database.

Wary of concerns about the institutionalization of food charity, on the one hand, and recognizing the escalating daily reliance on food banks, on the other, this paper seeks to address potential technical supply problems and challenges food banks face and open debate about the organizational networks of food banks more generally. The results show nonprofit entities based on a voluntary workforce who run supply chains in order to join both social and business targets. Their situation, performance, resources, mutual relationships and the links with other entities are described, paying special attention to the changes induced by the latest contextual changes. In short, food banks are efficiently organized and well established in their territories as a coherent social movement, although they should improve in their strategic view, coordination, resources and sources of these, to satisfy more adequately their increasingly complex demands. © 2017 by the authors.","Food banks; Management; Nonprofit sector; Social movements; Socioeconomic crisis; Spain","adaptive management; basic needs; crisis management; demand analysis; food security; institutional framework; nonprofit organization; questionnaire survey; social movement; socioeconomic status; Spain",,"Coque, J.; Department of Business Administration, Wifredo Ricart Street, Spain; email: coque@uniovi.es","MDPI",20711050,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018501761

Distributed Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) allow accurate clock-synchronized measurements of voltage and current phasors (amplitudes, phase angles) and frequencies. The sensor data from PMUs provide situational awareness in the grid, and are used as input for control decisions. A modification of sensor data can severely impact grid stability, overall power supply, and physical devices. Since power grids are critical infrastructures, WAMSs are tempting targets for all kinds of attackers, including well-organized and motivated adversaries such as terrorist groups or adversarial nation states. Such groups possess sufficient resources to launch sophisticated attacks. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of attack possibilities on WAMSs. We model the dependencies and building blocks of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) on WAMSs using attack trees. We consider the whole WAMS infrastructure, including aggregation and data collection points, such as Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs), classical IT components, and clock synchronization. Since Smart Grids are cyber-physical systems, we consider physical perturbations, in addition to cyber attacks in our models. The models provide valuable information about the chain of cyber or physical attack steps that can be combined to build a sophisticated attack for reaching a higher goal. They assist in the assessment of physical and cyber vulnerabilities, and provide strategic guidance for the deployment of suitable countermeasures. © 2017 ACM.","Attack model; Attack tree; Security issues; Sophisticated attacks; Wide area monitoring security","Clocks; Computer crime; Embedded systems; Forestry; Network security; Phasor measurement units; Smart power grids; Terrorism; Units of measurement; Attack model; Attack tree; Security issues; Sophisticated attacks; Wide area monitoring; Electric power transmission networks",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450349789,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019048702

With the globalization of semiconductor industry, more and more chips and devices are designed, integrated and fabricated by untrusted manufacturers, who can potentially insert hardware Trojans for launching attacks after the devices are deployed. Moreover, the most damaging attack in a smart grid is a large scale electricity failure, which can cause very serious consequences that are worse than any disaster. Unfortunately, this attack can be implemented very easily by synchronized hardware Trojans acting as a collective offline time bomb; the Trojans do not need to interact with one another and can affect a large fraction of nodes in a power grid. More sophisticatedly, this attack can also be realized by online hardware Trojans which keep listening to the communication channel and wait for a trigger event to trigger their malicious payloads; here, a broadcast message triggers all the Trojans at the same time. In this paper, we address the offline synchronized hardware Trojan attack, as it does not require the adversary to penetrate the power grid network for sending triggers. We classify two types of offline synchronized hardware Trojan attacks as type A and B: type B requires communication between different nodes, and type A does not. The hardware Trojans needed for type B turn out to be much more complex (and therefore larger in area size) than those for type A. In order to prevent type A attacks we suggest to enforce each power grid node to work in an unique time domain which has a random time offset to Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). This isolation principle can mitigate type A offline synchronized hardware Trojan attacks in a smart grid, such that even if hardware Trojans are implanted in functional units, e.g. Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), they can only cause a minimal damage, i.e. sporadic single node failures. The proposed solution only needs a trusted Global Positioning System (GPS) module which provides the correct UTC together with small additional interface circuitry. This means that our solution can be used to protect the current power grid infrastructure against type A offline attacks without replacing any untrusted functional unit, which may already have embedded hardware Trojans.","Hardware trojan; Smart grid; Supply chain management; Synchronization","Coordination reactions; Electric power transmission networks; Global positioning system; Hardware; Integrated circuit manufacture; Malware; Manufacture; Phasor measurement units; Semiconductor device manufacture; Semiconductor devices; Smart power grids; Supply chain management; Synchronization; Units of measurement; Interface circuitry; Phasor measurement unit (PMUs); Power grid networks; Remote terminal units; Semiconductor industry; Single node failure; Smart grid; Universal coordinated time; Hardware security","NSF: 1611095",,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450349789,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019035325

The CO2 emission is investigated through two aspects in our proposed model. From the first aspect, strategic decisions are made in the design phase of the supply chain to invest in equipment with low emissions in factories. In fact, carbon emission costs are taken into account along with fixed and variable costs of location and production. Furthermore, in terms of operational planning, CO2 gas emissions related to transportation modes and production are embedded in the model. The proposed model also takes into consideration the uncertain demand and production costs to more compatibility with the real world industries. A robust approach is used to formulation the model to overcome the uncertain parameters. Moreover, the risk of facilities’ disruption is predicted under different scenarios and a reliable model is presented. A solution approach is advised based on Benders’ decomposition algorithm and computational studies show its efficiency.

However, the pathway to biofuel industry maturity faces unique, unaddressed challenges. To address this challenges, this paper presents an optimization model which quantifies and controls the impact of biomass quality variability on supply chain related decisions and technology selection. We propose a two-stage stochastic programming model and associated efficient solution procedures for solving large-scale problems to (1) better represent the random nature of the biomass quality (defined by moisture and ash contents) in supply chain modeling, and (2) assess the impact of these uncertainties on the supply chain design and planning. The proposed model is then applied to a case study in the state of Tennessee. Results show that high moisture and ash contents negatively impact the unit delivery cost since poor biomass quality requires the addition of quality control activities. Experimental results indicate that supply chain cost could increase as much as 27%–31% when biomass quality is poor. We assess the impact of the biomass quality on the topological supply chain. Our case study indicates that biomass quality impacts supply chain costs; thus, it is important to consider the impact of biomass quality in supply chain design and management decisions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Biofuels; Biomass; L-shaped; Optimization; Quality costing; Stochastic programming; Supply chain network design","Biofuels; Costs; Moisture; Optimization; Quality control; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Uncertainty analysis; Bio-energy; Efficient solution procedure; L-shaped; Optimization modeling; Supply chain modeling; Supply chain network design; Technology selection; Two-stage stochastic programming; Biomass","NSF: 1462420","Castillo-Villar, K.K.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, One UTSA Circle, United States; email: Krystel.Castillo@utsa.edu","Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015729765

By reason of sufficient wind power during light load period, conventional power sources are not able to reduce adequate output capacity to meet peak-shaving requirement and improve wind power congestion situation. To fully utilize the congested wind power caused by peak-load regulation deficiency, a supply chain game based strategy for high-energy load enterprises is proposed. A model of quantifying the congested wind power is introduced first. To consume the congested wind power, a supply chain is constructed, including wind farms, transmission networks and high-energy load enterprises. Furthermore, the decision model for each participant is proposed by taking into account their benefit and corresponding technical constraints in forming revenue functions. To model both competitive and cooperative modes, different supply chain games are proposed based on non-cooperative and cooperative game theories. Models for solving these games are provided subsequently based on which, a hybrid decision model is presented to high-energy load enterprises. The model is not only able to consume congested wind power, but also to maximize the revenues of supply chain participants.

This framework is based on the functional-unit-based life cycle optimization approach and the leader-follower Stackelberg game structure to capture the decentralized feature and noncooperative relationships between multiple stakeholders across the product life cycle. The leader enjoys the priority of decision-making to optimize both its own economic performance and the life cycle environmental performance of the supply chain or product system. After the observation of leader’s decisions, the follower takes actions correspondingly to optimize its own economic performance. The resulting problem is formulated as a mixed-integer bilevel fractional program to account for conflicting objectives and interactions among different stakeholders. Design and operational decisions for both leader and follower are taken into consideration, including facility allocation, technology selection, production planning, transportation and storage scheduling, etc. To tackle the computational challenge of the resulting mixed-integer bilevel fractional programs, a tailored solution algorithm is developed based on a parametric algorithm and a projection-based reformulation and decomposition method.

The objective of this study is to reveal research gaps that can be closed with the help of simulation modelling. First, recent literature on both optimisation and simulation modelling is analysed. Second, a simulation model for multi-stage supply chain design with consideration of capacity disruptions and experimental results is presented in order to depict major areas of simulation application to the ripple effect modelling.

Afterwards, a fuzzy linear integer programming model is stated and solved for each pair of subsequent SCN stages to determine the quantities required from each stakeholder to maximise the overall SCN efficiency while satisfying the estimated demand and respecting the nodes capacity. Finally, a heuristics is applied to limit the exchange of small quantities in the SCN, in which the trade is not economically convenient according to quantity discounts.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of sunitinib treatment on tumor vasculature and oxygenation in melanoma xenografts with different angiogenic profiles. A-07, U-25, D-12, or R-18 melanoma xenografts were grown in dorsal window chambers and given daily treatments of sunitinib (40 mg/kg) or vehicle. Morphologic parameters of tumor vascular networks were assessed from high-resolution transillumination images, and tumor blood supply times (BSTs) were assessed from first-pass imaging movies. Tumor hypoxia was assessed with immunohistochemistry by using pimonidazole as hypoxia marker, and the gene expression and the protein secretion rate of angiogenic factors were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. The melanoma lines differed substantially in the expression of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and platelet-derived growth factor A. Sunitinib treatment reduced vessel densities and induced hypoxia in all melanoma lines, and the magnitude of the effect was associated with the gene expression and protein secretion rate of VEGF-A. Sunitinib treatment also increased vessel segment lengths, reduced the number of small-diameter vessels, and inhibited growth-induced increases in the diameter of surviving vessels but did not change BST. In conclusion, sunitinib treatment did not improve vascular function but reduced vessel density and induced hypoxia in human melanoma xenografts. The magnitude of the treatment-induced effect was associated with the VEGF-A expression of the melanoma lines. © 2016 The Authors",,"alpha smooth muscle actin; biologic factors and agents acting on the immune system; pimonidazole; platelet derived growth factor A; sunitinib; vasculotropin C; adult; angiogenesis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; drug efficacy; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; gene expression; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; intravital microscopy; melanoma; mouse; nonhuman; pericyte; real time polymerase chain reaction; tumor hypoxia; tumor xenograft","NCS; sorost","Gaustad, J.-V.; Group of Radiation Biology and Tumor Physiology, Montebello, Norway; email: Jon.Vidar.Gaustad@rr-research.no","Neoplasia Press, Inc.",19365233,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034253026

Methods: Planning a distribution network plays a vital role in minimizing the total expenditure of the project; to prove this, a ring network topology is taken to supply goods to the SWs and extended star network topology to supply goods to the selling stores. However, setting up separate SWs for each and every selling store will be highly expensive. Hence, keeping the minimum number of SWs is very important. Selection of SWs from the available SWs is done by replacing diverse values based on the distance limitation. Results: The suggested model is validated with the mathematical problem, and the optimum set of SWs is identified from the result. The result has been substantiated using analytic hierarchy process.

The post-Soviet development of tourism industry and of the hospitality sector as of one of its most important constituent elements in Russia has unveiled the ever increasing misbalance between the demand for the high-quality products (services) on behalf of the consumers and the capabilities of the most hotel companies to ensure the qualitative and quantitative parameters of the services to supply the market. Development of the travel and hospitality industry under the modern conditions in Russia raises a number of new problems. One of them is represented by the lack of any sufficiently structured methodology and methods for establishing the transnational hotel chains (THC). The world practices of the hotel business development demonstrate convincingly that the most adequate and economically feasible form of operations of the hotel companies is represented by the hotel chains of national and transnational scale which, however, have not been developed extensively enough in this country. © 2017.

Intermodal freight transportation system is perceived to be a sustainable means of bridging the gap between producers and consumers in the worldwide supply and demand chain. Research into maritime-hinterland transportation has been the focus of most researchers currently. The optimisation of intermodal freight transportation network system is therefore very crucial for maritime-hinterland transportation solutions. This paper provides an integrated optimisation model which take into account cost, transit time and carbon emissions and the trade-offs among these factors to ensure sustainable intermodal network systems. A numerical experiment was performed using data from a developing country, Ghana as the focus of this study. The results offer a real insight into how trade-offs among cost, time and carbon emissions could benefit all the stakeholders within the intermodal network system.","Freight transportation; Inland port; Intermodal transportation; Maritime port; Network optimization; Sustainability","Commerce; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Economics; Intermodal transportation; International trade; Optimization; Sustainable development; Transportation; Transportation routes; Inland port; Intermodal freight transport; Maritime port; Network optimization; Numerical experiments; Optimisation models; Supply and demand chains; Technological innovation; Freight transportation",,"Agbo, A.A.; School of Logistics Engineering, China; email: aaron.agbo2000@yahoo.com","Institute for Transport Studies in the European Economic Integration",18253997,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019944126

Due to limited power supply, the satisfiability of performability properties, which include energy constraints especially, must be confirmed in design phase. This will help one to avoid implementing impracticable designs. A typical performability property may be as follows: the probability that the energy consumption of a sensor node is smaller than 5 if it operates correctly in 1 hour is bigger than 0.90. Stochastic model checking is a successful and well established technique for formally verifying performability properties of systems which exhibit stochastic behavior. This paper introduces continuous time Markov Chain (CTMC) enhanced with reward structures to model the dynamic behavior of a sensor node. The performability specification which includes energy constraints can be depicted by continuous stochastic reward logic (CSRL). Our main contribution is a verification approach of sensor nodes' performability properties, which include energy constraints especially, based on stochastic model checking technique. Moreover, we show the applicability of the approach and provide some experimental results by stochastic model checker MRMC.","Markov processes; Performance evaluation; Stochastic model checking; Wireless sensor network","Computer network performance evaluation; Continuous time systems; Energy utilization; Low power electronics; Markov processes; Model checking; Sensor nodes; Stochastic systems; Wireless sensor networks; Continuous time Markov chain; Dynamic behaviors; Limited power supply; Performability evaluation; Performance evaluation; Stochastic behavior; Well-established techniques; Wireless techniques; Stochastic models","ESSCKF201302; NSFC: 51204185, 61272107; ZJNSF: 2014C31059, LY15F020010; SKLSE: SKLSE2014-10- 05",,"Computer Society of the Republic of China",19911599,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018693110

Traditional facility location models for supply chain design focus on the tradeoffs between the costs and benefits of proximity, i.e., the distance between facilities and customers. These strategic-focused models do not consider the supply chain's agility, i.e., its ability to quickly respond to unexpected fluctuations in customer needs. In this paper, we study the problem of designing a supply chain distribution network under demand uncertainty and analyze how the optimal design characteristics of proximity and agility depend on various input parameters. We are able to draw managerial insights on how agility considerations may invalidate well-established and widely accepted qualitative results derived from traditional models. In particular,we showthat it is optimal to increase the density of distribution centers (DCs) when the shortage penalty cost increases, and to decrease the density of DCs when a certain unit transportation cost parameter increases. Through these findings, our work conveys the message that traditional, proximity-based facility location models can be inadequate for designing modern responsive supply chains, and calls for the need to develop a new class of models for the task. © 2016 INFORMS.","Facility location; Inventory sharing; Supply chain design","Costs; Facilities; Location; Uncertainty analysis; Costs and benefits; Density of distribution; Facility location models; Facility locations; Inventory sharing; Supply chain design; Traditional models; Transportation cost; Supply chains","DAG09/10, DAG11EG08G; NSF: CMMI 1265671; NSFC: 71210002, 71332005",,"INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences",00251909,,MSCIA,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017300308

However, the vulnerabilities in the IoT supply chain have raised serious concerns about the security and trustworthiness of IoT devices and components within them. Testing for device provenance, detection of counterfeit integrated circuits (ICs) and systems, and traceability of IoT devices are challenging issues to address. In this article, we develop a novel radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based system suitable for counterfeit detection, traceability, and authentication in the IoT supply chain called CDTA. CDTA is composed of different types of on-chip sensors and in-system structures that collect necessary information to detect multiple counterfeit IC types (recycled, cloned, etc.), track and trace IoT devices, and verify the overall system authenticity. Central to CDTA is an RFID tag employed as storage and a channel to read the information from different types of chips on the printed circuit board (PCB) in both power-on and power-off scenarios. CDTA sensor data can also be sent to the remote server for authentication via an encrypted Ethernet channel when the IoT device is deployed in the field. A novel board ID generator is implemented by combining outputs of physical unclonable functions (PUFs) embedded in the RFID tag and different chips on the PCB. A light-weight RFID protocol is proposed to enable mutual authentication between RFID readers and tags. We also implement a secure interchip communication on the PCB. Simulations and experimental results using Spartan 3E FPGAs demonstrate the effectiveness of this system. The efficiency of the radio-frequency (RF) communication has also been verified via a PCB prototype with a printed slot antenna. © 2017 ACM.","Authentication; Counterfeit detection; Internet of Things (IoT); Radio-frequency identification (RFID); Supply chain security; Traceability","Authentication; Cloning; Crime; Cryptography; Digital storage; Integrated circuits; Microstrip antennas; Network security; Printed circuit boards; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Radio waves; Slot antennas; Supply chains; Integrated circuits (ICs); Interchip communications; Internet of thing (IOT); Internet of Things (IOT); Printed circuit boards (PCB); Radio frequency communication; Supply chain security; Traceability; Internet of things",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",10844309,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017172591

One efficient way to elevate sustainability is the consideration of corporate social responsibility (CSR) by designing a closed loop supply chain (CLSC). This paper has developed a mathematical model to increase corporate social responsibility in terms of job creation. Moreover the model, in addition to increasing total CLSC profit, provides a range of strategic decision solutions for decision makers to select a best action plan for a CLSC. A proposed multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model was solved with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Fuzzy set theory was employed to select the best compromise solution from the Pareto-optimal solutions. A numerical example was used to validate the potential application of the proposed model. The results highlight the effect of CSR in the design of CLSC. © 2017 Pedram et al.

Companies with common activities in their supply chains have started to cooperate with each other to achieve better service levels. Based on this initiative, a multi-level mixed-integer linear programming model is developed that includes two allied supply chains with different decision makers (DM) at two different decision-making levels. The primary aim of this study is to design an allied closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network that uses some of the same facilities. The secondary aim of this study is to examine this allied CLSC model simultaneously and analyse the impact of the DMs’ objectives based on satisfaction degrees. Various interactive fuzzy programming (IFP) approaches were utilized to examine the presented multi-level CLSC model. A novel IFP approach which is based on the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed IFP approach on the CLSC model is investigated with hypothetical data. The computational results show that the proposed approach obtains higher satisfaction degrees for upper-level DMs than the other approaches. © 2016, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Allied supply chains; Decentralized closed-loop supply chain; Interactive fuzzy programming; Multi-level programming","Analytic hierarchy process; Decision making; Fuzzy systems; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); Computational results; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Interactive fuzzy programming; Mixed integer linear programming model; Multilevel programming; Supply chain network design; Integer programming",,"Çalık, A.; Department of Statistics, Turkey; email: ahmetcalik@selcuk.edu.tr","Springer Berlin Heidelberg",15622479,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016731863

Despite the inclusion of residual chlorine in drinking water distribution systems supplies, the bacterium is a recalcitrant human pathogen capable of forming biofilms on pipe walls and causing health risks. Typical drinking water bacterial biofilms and their response to different concentrations of chlorination was monitored. The results showed that the four bacteria all formed single biofilms susceptible to sodium hypochlorite. After 30 min disinfection, biomass and cultivability decreased with increasing concentration of disinfectant but then increased in high disinfectant doses. PMA-qPCR results indicated that it resulted in little cellular damage. Flow cytometry analysis showed that with increasing doses of disinfectant, the numbers of clusters increased and the sizes of clusters decreased.

As a result, most companies have increasingly been choosing the application of performance measurement systems. This significantly results in poor performance measurement regarding future business lagging measure. To solve this problem, this research presents a hybrid predictive performance measurement system (PPMS) using the neuro-fuzzy approach based on particle swarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO). It is constructed from many leading aspects of convenience store performance measures and projects the competitive level of future business lagging measure. To do so, monthly store performance measures were first congregated from the case study value chains. Second, data cleaning and preparations by headquarter accounting verification were carried out before the proposed model construction. Third, these results were used as the learning dataset to derive a predictive performance measurement system based on ANFIS-PSO. The fuzzy value of each leading input was optimized by parallel processing PSO, before feeding to the neuro-fuzzy system. Finally, the model provides a future performance for the next month’s sales and expense to managers who focused on managing a store using desirability function (Di). It boosted the sales growth in 2012 by ten percentages using single PPMS. Additionally, the composite PPMS was also boosted by the same growth rate for the store in the blind test (July 2013–February 2014). From the experimental results, it can be concluded that ANFIS-PSO delivers high-accuracy modeling, delivering much smaller error and computational time compared to artificial neural network model and supports vector regression but its component searching time differs significantly because of the complexity of each model. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Neuro-fuzzy; Predictive performance measurement system; Retailing value chain; Swarm intelligence","Artificial intelligence; Chains; Deep neural networks; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sales; Supply chain management; Swarm intelligence; Artificial neural network modeling; Desirability function; Neuro-Fuzzy; Neuro-fuzzy approach; Parallel processing; Performance measurement system; Predictive performance; Value chains; Fuzzy inference","CMU; TRF: PHD/0090/2553","Leksakul, K.; Excellence Center in Logistics and Supply Chain Management, Thailand; email: komgrit@eng.cmu.ac.th","Springer Verlag",14327643,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016079917

Based on a case analysis of a leading Chinese B2C firm W, a two-stage supply chain structure covering procurementstock and inventory-sale management is constructed. The research shows overall supply chain inefficiency is attributable to procurement-stock conversion inefficiency. From a view of operations model, the third-party platform model is more efficient than a “shop in shop” self-operated model. However, the self-operated mode performs better in product categories such as computer & Office & digital, food & drink and healthy products due to these products’ delivery characteristics and consumers’ shopping habits. In the logistics selection, most e-retail players are inclined to choose the hybrid model of 3PL and self-operated logistics with the product category extension from vertical model to all-category model. These findings may help managers improve supplier-buyer relationship and strengthen supply chain management.

With respect to the total cost, the aim is determining opened plants and DCs and designing transportation trees between the facilities. Considering the capacity of suppliers, plants and DCs are limited and there is a limitation on the maximum number of opened plants and DCs, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model of the problem is presented. Since multi-stage supply chain networks have been recognized as NP-hard problems, applying priority-based encoding and a four-step backward decoding procedure, a meta-heuristic algorithm, namely GAIWO, based on the best features of genetic algorithm (GA) and invasive weed optimization (IWO) is designed to solve the problem. In small size problems, the efficiency of the GAIWO is checked by solutions of GAMS software. For larger size problems, the performance of the proposed approach is compared with four evolutionary algorithms in both aspects of the structure of the GAIWO and the efficiency of the proposed encoding-decoding procedure. Besides usual evaluation criteria, Wilcoxon test and a chess rating system are used for evaluating and ranking the algorithms.

The increased pressure of pharmacies to order fewer products and to receive them more frequently is overcharging the pharmaceutical's distribution network. Furthermore, the tight margins and the continuous growth of generic drugs consumption are pressing wholesalers to optimize their supply chains. In order to survive, wholesalers are rethinking their strategies to increase competitiveness. This paper proposes an optimization-simulation approach to address the wholesalers network redesign problem, trading off the operational costs and customer service level. Firstly, at a strategic-tactical level, the supply chain network redesign decisions are optimized via a mixed integer programming model. Here, the number, location, function and capacity of the warehouses, the allocation of customers to the warehouses and the capacity and function of the distribution channels are defined. Secondly, at an operation level, the solution found is evaluated by means of a discrete event simulation model to assess the impact of the redesign in the wholesaler's daily activities.

Previous studies have focused on the economic, social, and ecological efficiency of single and dual systems in a composite system, thus ignoring the impact of other subsystems. Drawing on the theory of system, this study constructs a ring structure of a complex marine system and then selects a corresponding decision-making unit on the basis of labor and capital circulation in each subsystem to calculate the efficiency of the chain structure using a network Data Envelope Analysis (DEA) model. The results revealed that while social-ecological-economic efficiency increased, social-economic-ecological and ecological-social-economic efficiencies remained stable. By contrast, economic-social-ecological and ecological-economic-social efficiencies showed a downward trend, whereas economic-ecological-social efficiency demonstrated varying changes.

Techniques such as cluster analysis, graph visualization, descriptive statistics and concepts from social network analysis (SNA) were adopted to carry out the study. Our analyses show that only 15% of targeted firms collaborate, or have previously collaborated, with two or more companies and that close to one-third of the firms are unwilling to contribute financially for a training/development programme. Finally, a majority of the firms are willing to spend 15 days or less, which is assumed to be far below the minimum for an effective inter-firm improvement programme. Perhaps more interestingly, our study reveals that “open firms” are also more positive to contribute in improvement programmes. Several implications and guidance can be drawn from this study (e.g. need of a greater number of inter-firm collaborations, joint development initiatives including also foreign supplier firms, international oil companies and learning institutions). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Africa; Cluster analysis; Developing countries; Industrial network approach; Oil and gas supply chain",,,"Calignano, G.email: giuseppe.calignano@uis.no","Elsevier Ltd",2214790X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011879015

Considering interactions among criteria, a TL-ANP approach, in which comparison matrices are consistent 2-tuple linguistic preference relations, is put forward to determine weights of criteria and sub-criteria. To deal with the case of criteria being not compensated, an IT-ELECTRE II approach is proposed. In this approach, ratings of alternatives on sub-criteria are represented as interval 2-tuple linguistic variables. A possible degree and a likelihood-based preference degree are respectively defined, followed by concordance, discordance and indifferent sets. Afterwards, concordance and discordance indices are identified and applied to establish net concordance and net discordance indices. Further, comprehensive dominant values of alternatives are obtained to rank alternatives.

Yet, the Large Neighborhood Search technique (LNS) has almost never been suggested for solving such problems, although it has proven its efficiency and flexibility in solving other complex combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we propose an LNS framework for solving a four-layer single period multi-product supply chain network design problem. One important feature of the model is that it includes inter-modality: the itinerary followed by the cargo from origin to destination may take several transportation modes. Moreover, several modes may compete on some arcs. Location decisions for intermediate facilities (e.g. plants and distribution centers) are determined by the LNS while transportation modes and product flow decisions are determined by a greedy heuristic. As a post-optimization step, linear programming is used to optimize product flows once the structure of the logistics network is fixed. Extensive experiments, based on randomly generated instances of different sizes and characteristics, show the effectiveness of the method compared with a state-of-the-art solver. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Facility location; Large Neighborhood Search; Supply chain network design","Combinatorial optimization; Heuristic algorithms; Linear programming; Location; Number theory; Supply chains; Approximate solution; Combinatorial optimization problems; Distribution centers; Facility location problem; Facility locations; Large neighborhood search; Supply chain network design; Transportation mode; Product design","","Péton, O.; IMT Atlantique, 4 rue Alfred Kastler, France; email: olivier.peton@mines-nantes.fr","Elsevier Ltd",03050548,,CMORA,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996844580

Economies of scale in the production of liquid fuels from lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks favor large centralized biorefineries. Increasing transportation efficiency through torrefaction and pelletization at distributed satellite facilities may serve as a means to expand the utilization of forestry residuals in biofuel production. To investigate this potential, a mixed-integer linear program was developed to optimize the feedstock supply chain design with and without distributed pretreatment. The model uses techno-economic assessment of scale-dependent biomass pretreatment processes from existing literature and multimodal biomass transportation cost evaluations derived from a spatially explicit network analysis as input. In addition, the sensitivity of the optimal system configuration was determined for variations of key input parameters including the production scale of pretreatment facilities, road and rail transportation costs, and feedstock procurement costs. Torrefaction and densification were found to reduce transportation costs by $0.84 per GJ and overall delivered costs by $0.24 per GJ, representing 14.5% and 5.2% cost reductions compared to feedstock collection without pretreatment. Significant uncertainties remain in terms of the costs associated with deploying torrefaction equipment at the scales modeled, but the level of potential cost savings suggests further analysis and development of these alternatives. © 2016 The Authors.

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), an important environmental policy approach, has been adopted extensively in various countries, and the effectiveness of its implementation has been proven through practical application. However, the establishment and development of EPR are lacking in most developing countries where collection and recycling systems are underdeveloped. This study addresses this problem by exploring the hierarchical relationship among the driving factors of EPR in the electronics industry in China and by identifying and ranking the factors that are critical in EPR implementation. As important managerial conclusions, research results show that EPR-related laws and regulations, the consciousness of senior executives, and corporate image are the three most important driving factors of EPR implementation. © 2017 by the authors.","Analytic Network Process; Driving factors; Extended Producer Responsibility; Interpretative Structure Modelling","analytical framework; developing world; electronics industry; environmental economics; environmental management; environmental policy; implementation process; modeling; ranking; recycling; supply chain management; China",,"Xu, F.; Business School, China; email: xufc@mail.nankai.edu.cn","MDPI",20711050,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017334824

However, the access to and availability of locally harvested fish and seafood in the province is notably lacking, particularly since federal and provincial policies have prioritized the development of export markets in the fisheries over local sales. In this paper, we examine market actors and civil society organizations in St. John's (the provincial capital) and Petty Harbour (a nearby fishing community) that have embarked on initiatives to better include fish and seafood in the local food system. The success of these initiatives depends in part on the degree of connectivity between consumers and harvesters, as well as between people, the culture of fishing, and the marine environment. Results: Reconnections are the foundations of alternative food networks (AFNs), which aim to develop more environmentally and socially sustainable and localized ways of producing, distributing, retailing, and consuming food. This paper explores the social, cultural, and ecological values of the fisheries as means to forging reconnections. The research reveals that values pertaining to traditional food culture, environmental stewardship and conservation, localization, and social cohesion were significant motivating factors for stakeholders in seeking out reconnection in their food system. Conclusions: While AFNs in Newfoundland's fisheries are currently underdeveloped, reconnections are nonetheless taking place along the fisheries supply chain and can contribute to enhancing the accessibility and availability of locally harvested fish. The study also finds that AFNs must be context appropriate and reflect local values, as there are significant opportunities in building on Newfoundland's strong fishing culture and heritage. © 2017 The Author(s).","Alternative food networks; Fisheries; Reconnection; Values",,"SSHRC: 895 -2011-1011","DesRivières, C.P.; Carleton University, Canada; email: chloe.poitevin@carleton.ca","BioMed Central Ltd.",20487010,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016461091

The proposed framework aims at modeling performance measurement, and forecasting of a selected hospital's drug suppliers.

For this reason, ANFIS model has been integrated to DEA due to its nonlinear mapping, strong generalization capabilities and pattern prediction functionalities. DEA based BCC model is used to evaluate the efficiency scores of a set of suppliers, then ANFIS intervenes to learn DEA patterns and to forecast the performance of new suppliers.

However, forecasting it faces several challenges including frequent shortages, and possible expiration caused by demand uncertainty of hospitals. This uncertainty is mainly due to high variability in the number of emergency cases. Thereupon, this investigation presents a real case study of forecasting monthly demand of three blood components, using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The demand of the three blood components (red blood cells (RBC), plasma (CP) and platelets (PFC)) and other observations are obtained from a central transfusion blood center and a University Hospital. Experiments are carried out using three networks to forecast each blood component separately. Last, the presented model is compared with ARIMA to evaluate its performance in prediction. The results of this study depict that ANN models overcomes ARIMA models in demand forecasting. Thus high ANN models can be considered as a promising approach in forecasting monthly blood demand. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Artificial neural networks; Blood components demand; Blood supply chain; Forecasting","Big data; Forecasting; Hospitals; Neural networks; Supply chains; Blood component; Blood supply; Demand and supply management; Demand forecasting; Demand uncertainty; Monthly demand; Red blood cell; Three networks; Blood",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450348522,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028449243

Research has typically focused on only the macro-viewpoint, classifying each company pair into a specific relation type. In this paper, to support company relation analysis from both macro-and micro-viewpoints, we propose a method that extracts collaborative/competitive company pairs from individual sentences in Web news articles by applying a Markov logic network and gather extracted relations from each company pair. By this method, we are able not only to perform clustering of company pairs into competitor groups based on the dominant relations of each pair (macro-viewpoint) but also to know how each company pair is described in individual sentences (micro-viewpoint).

Demand of goods which is increasing and also diversing will certainly have an impact on the process of transportation of goods involving a freight forwarder. Shipping of goods is part of the supply chain, which handles the flow of goods, distribution and delivery service or commonly called the courier. Fulfilling the request of goods would require Logistics Service Provider (LSP) that distribute goods from point of origin to destination. Delays in the distribution of goods will slow(DOWN) economic growth in Malang, therefore focused studies on the movement of goods which includes the election of the delivery route is needed. The purpose of this study is to get the delivery route for LSP by identifying its patterns of freight transport movement and to analyze the network performance of the road that is passed by freight transportation. Data collection techniques in this research are interviews, questionnaires and observations of moving-car and traffic counting to get the volume of traffic. The study used road's performance analysis to get the level of service (LOS) of roads which are used by the freight transportation of LSP and Dijkstra's algorithm analysis to determine the delivery routes. The results showed that the Level of Service of the roads (LOS) is at the level of D to F which indicates that the chosen roads experience instability of traffic flow even reach a critical condition. Therefore by considering delivery routes selection both of existing condition and analysis result as well as the condition of the road network in Malang, then given alternative is by deliverying goods on the chosen routes but not at peak hour. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economics; Education; Freight transportation; Internet service providers; Logistics; Roads and streets; Sports; Supply chains; Surveys; Traffic control; Transportation; Transportation routes; Critical condition; Dijkstra's algorithms; Freight forwarders; Freight transport; Logistic services; Logistics service provider; Performance analysis; Transportation of goods; Distribution of goods",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing",17578981,,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016626854

This study suggests the transformation by conducting a postharvest engineering by the application of appropriate technology. As an ex-farm strategy, postharvest engineering offers less interventions to any existing process taken by least developing societal groups. In parallel, appropriate technology puts an emphasis on the sustainability of a technological solution by using indigenous knowledge as its basis. Their combination will then transform the whole supply-chain in terms of four different perspectives. Technically, supply-chain complexity requires an interconnected calculation of supply-demand network. Besides, economic value added needs to be redistributed throughout the chain. Next, applying an appropriate technology in conducting postharvest processing will change the life-cycle assessment of a commodity being treated. Then, involved parties in the chain require a renewed partnership to intermediate different interests. In short, this study proposes a notion on a set of comprehensive solutions from different views to solve problematic issues within any agricultural supply-chain in many developing countries.","Agricultural supply-chain; Appropriate technology; Life-cycle assessment; Postharvest engineering; Social partnership; Sustainability; Value chain",,,,"International Society for Horticultural Science",05677572,9789462611498,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017532199

Attention has been directed to developing such forms of food supply by adapting information connectivity. A case study of a local food network in Norway indicates that local food supply paradoxically attempts to mimic the dominant industrialised modes of food production. It is suggested that the fact that local food supply is ""personal"" and associated with close proximity makes it more closely resemble service supply chains. Applying contingency theory, a conceptual model is developed that indicates how the local food supply must take into consideration the degree to which customer value is associated with tailoring food supply. The high need for tailored local food production implies that information connectivity should support mutual adaptation while, in cases of less need for tailoring information, connectivity should seek automation. Local food production is always a hybrid of these approaches. © 2017, IGI Global.

This paper proposes a resilience analysis framework for the analysis and design of logistics network on how to help the network to cope with complexity under disruption. Under the resilience analysis framework, the logistics network is modeled as a probabilistic network graph, the resilience can then be analyzed by the reliability of all the independent connection paths among the logistics entities with connection weightings. The design of the logistics network is then further proposed by (1) risk sharing and resilience enhancement by means of the redundancy effect, and (2) restoration and recovery of the network by means of dependency routing. Therefore, this paper can provide an efficient way to analyze and design the stability of the logistics network as well as to understand the ability of the network to return to a stable state after disruptions from failure. © 2016 IEEE.","logistics network; network analysis; network design; network resilience; supply chain network","Control systems; Electric network analysis; Reliability analysis; Risk management; Supply chains; Transportation; Analysis frameworks; Learning from the pasts; Logistics network; Network design; Network resilience; Probabilistic network; Risk-sharing; Supply chain network; Logistics",,"Lam, C.Y.; Graduate School of Engineering, 1-4-1, Kagamiyama, Japan","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781908320636,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018373091

This study addresses human rights issues related to Occupational Safety and Health for people suffering injuries from work demanded as a result of international trade arrangements. Here we present Occupational Safety and Health Footprints, which include the number of work-related accidents that occur throughout the world and that are directly and indirectly linked to the consumption of products, calculated for every nation's consumption bundle. OSHF include fatal footprints, non-fatal footprints, days lost footprints and wages lost footprints per given year. In order to calculate the OSHF, we used a comprehensive Multi-Regional Input Output MRIO table (Eora) in addition to data from the International Labour Organization, ASEAN Occupational Safety and Health Network (ASEAN-OSHNET) and others. This study finds that in 2010 there were 12 fatal and 4.8 thousand non-fatal incidents, 27 thousand days lost and two million US$ lost in wages per 100 thousand workers in supply chains worldwide. The results presented in this paper show hidden accidents throughout global supply chains and hence can be used to apply pressure on international organisations, governments and focal companies to improve the conditions of workers, particularly in terms of OSH in the workplace. © 2016","Global supply chains; International trade; Multi-regional input-output analysis; Occupational accidents footprint; Occupational safety and health; Social footprint","Accidents; Commerce; Compensation (personnel); Developing countries; Health; International trade; Supply chains; Wages; Global supply chain; Input output analysis; Occupational accident; Occupational safety and health; Social footprint; Occupational risks",,"Alsamawi, A.; Integrated Sustainability Analysis, Australia; email: ali.alsamawi@sydney.edu.au","Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013656996

Among various edible and non-edible bioenergy feedstocks specified for biodiesel production, Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) and waste cooking oil (WCO) have been introduced to be promising and sustainable. In this study, an integrated hybrid approach based on a data envelopment analysis (DEA) and mathematical programming techniques is presented for the strategic design of biodiesel supply chain network in Iran. In the first phase, JCL cultivation areas are assessed according to climatic and social criteria by a unified DEA (UDEA) model. In the second phase, the locations which have achieved desired efficiency scores are considered as candidate locations for JCL cultivation within a mathematical programming model developed for designing the biodiesel supply chain network. The proposed mathematical programming model optimizes the numbers, locations and capacities of JCL cultivation centers, JCL seeds and WCO collection centers, bio-refineries, and distribution centers. The proposed approach is implemented in Iran for 10 years planning horizon. The results show the usefulness and efficiency of the proposed method in assisting the policymakers to take suitable strategic and tactical level decisions related to biodiesel supply chain planning. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuel supply chain optimization; Data envelopment analysis; Jatropha curcas L.; Mathematical programming techniques; Sustainable development","Biodiesel; Data envelopment analysis; Energy security; Global warming; Location; Mathematical programming; Oils and fats; Sustainable development; Biodiesel production; Biodiesel supply chains; Biofuel supply chains; Candidate locations; Distribution centers; Environmental issues; Jatropha curcas l; Mathematical programming models; Supply chains",,"Pishvaee, M.S.; School of Industrial Engineering, Iran; email: pishvaee@iust.ac.ir","Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951760381

The objective is to propose an efficient technique for object identification, localization, and report generation to monitor the inventory level in real time video stream based on the object appearance model. The appearance model is considered as visual signature by which individual object can be detected anywhere via camera feed. Herein, Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) are used to identify the object. Firstly, SURF features are extracted from prototype image which refers to predefined template of individual objects, and then extracted from the camera feed of inventory i.e. scene image. Density based clustering on SURF points of prototype is done, followed by feature mapping of each cluster to SURF points in scene image. Homographic transforms are then used to obtain the location and mark the presence of objects in the scene image. Further, for better invariance to occlusion and faster computation, a novel method for tuning the hyper parameters of clustering is also proposed. The proposed methodology is found to be reliable and is able to give robust real time count of objects in inventory with invariance to scale, rotation and upto 70% of occlusion. © 2016 IEEE.","cluster parameter tuning; homographic transform; Object counting; speeded up robust feature","Artificial intelligence; Cameras; Image segmentation; Inventory control; Supply chains; Video streaming; Cluster parameters; Density-based Clustering; Industrial machine vision; Object counting; Object identification; Real-time video streams; Speeded up robust features; Supply chain network; Object detection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509055104,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017301079

Additional, hydrogen is regarded a likely key component to store and convert back excess electrical power to secure future energy supply and to improve the quality of biomass-based fuels. Therefore, future hydrogen supply and distribution chains will have to address several objectives. Such a complexity is a challenge for risk assessment and risk management of these chains because of the increasing interactions. Improved methods are needed to assess the supply chain as a whole. The method of “Functional modelling” is discussed in this paper. It will be shown how it could be a basis for other decision support methods for comprehensive risk and sustainability assessments. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Hydrogen refuelling stations; Power systems; Risk assessment; Supply chains; Sustainable assessment","Complex networks; Decision support systems; Hydrogen fuels; Risk management; Standby power systems; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Biomass-based fuels; Distribution chains; Functional modelling; Hydrogen infrastructure; Hydrogen refuelling stations; Sustainability analysis; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable assessment; Risk assessment",,"Markert, F.; Institute Management Engineering, Produktionstorvet 424, Denmark; email: fram@dtu.dk","Elsevier Ltd",03603199,,IJHED,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006415902

For this supply chain system we develop three different approaches, (i) an ideal plan for an infinite planning horizon and an updated plan if there are any changes in the data, (ii) a predictive mitigation planning approach for managing predictive demand changes, which can be predicted in advance by using an appropriate tool, and (iii) a reactive mitigation plan, on a real-time basis, for managing sudden production disruptions, which cannot be predicted in advance. In predictive mitigation planning, we develop a fuzzy inference system (FIS) tool to predict the changes in future demand over the base forecast and the supply chain plan is revised accordingly well in advance. In reactive mitigation planning, we formulate a quantitative model for revising production and distribution plans, over a finite future planning period, while minimizing the total supply chain cost. We also consider a series of sudden disruptions, where a new disruption may or may not affect the recovery plans of earlier disruptions and which consequently require plans to be revised after the occurrence of each disruption on a real-time basis. An efficient heuristic, capable of dealing with sudden production disruptions on a real-time basis, is developed. We compare the heuristic results with those obtained from the LINGO optimization software for a good number of randomly generated test problems. Also, some numerical examples are presented to explain both the usefulness and advantages of the proposed approaches. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Heuristic; Mitigation; Production disruption; Quantitative model; Supply chain","Chains; Fuzzy inference; Software testing; Distribution centers; Fuzzy inference systems; Heuristic; Infinite planning horizons; Mitigation; Optimization software; Quantitative modeling; Three-stage supply chain; Supply chains",,"Paul, S.K.; School of Business IT and Logistics, Australia; email: sanjoy.ipe@gmail.com","Elsevier B.V.",03772217,,EJORD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994507179

The aim of this study is to investigate the conditions necessary for microvascularization in a tissue-engineered construct using vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The construct was made of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) based cell-laden hydrogel system, which was then covalently linked with VEGF-mimicking peptide (AcQK), using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as the model cell. The results of the mechanics and gene expression analysis indicated significant changes in mechanical properties and upregulation of vascular-specific genes. The major finding of this study is that the increased expression of vascular-specific genes could be achieved by employing AcQK in the GelMA based hydrogel system, leading to accelerated microvascularization. We conclude that GelMA with covalently-linked angiogenic peptide is a useful tissue engineered construct suitable for microvascularization. Statement of Significance (1) This study reports the conditions necessary for microvascularization in a tissue-engineered construct using vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). (2) The construct was made of gelatin methacrylate based cell-laden hydrogel system. (3) There is a significant change observed in mechanical properties and upregulation of vascular-specific genes, in particular CD34, when AcQK is used.

While not restricted to the government domain, this dataification is certainly relevant in a government context, particularly due to the large volume of data generated by public institutions. In this paper we identify the various activities and roles within a data value chain, and hence proceed to provide our own definition of a Data Value Network. We specifically cater for non-tangible data products and characterise three dimensions that play a vital role within the Data Value Network. We also propose a Demand and Supply Distribution Model with the aim of providing insight on how an entity can participate in the global data market by producing a data product, as well as a concrete implementation through the Demand and Supply as a Service.

The integrated framework has been developed based on review of literature exercise as, a total of 922 studies were initially obtained from SCOPUS of which 64 studies were selected using focused exclusion and inclusion criteria. The review highlighted that citizens were the dominant user groups being studied while other stakeholders (like government, firms) were rarely covered in such studies. The review identified a total of 126 constructs which were further clubbed in to groups like people, technology, policy, institution and economic. An integrated framework for assessment of e-governance projects is developed. This integrated framework had identified dominant constructs. For people group, these are ease of use, usefulness, user awareness and satisfaction, adoption and social benefits and influence. For technology group, these are accessibility, infrastructure, reliability and website maturity. For policy group, these are laws and policies, privacy and security, transparency and user trust and effectiveness and empowerment. For economic group, these are affordability and cost of service and funding sustainability. For institution group, these are availability and performance, management support, quality (system, service and information) and operational efficiency. Validation of the relevance of this framework was done through qualitative case studies. One such study is the Passport Project of Ministry of External Affairs (a central government initiative, for citizens). Another such study is the Excise Supply Chain Information Management Systems for Liquor distribution in Delhi (a state government initiative for businesses). The relevance of the conceptual framework is explored using these case studies. © 2017 ACM.","Assessment; e-Governance; Framework; Service delivery model; Stakeholders","Economic and social effects; Information management; Network function virtualization; Public policy; Supply chains; Assessment; E-governance; Framework; Service delivery; Stakeholders; Government data processing",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450349307,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019769289

Design/methodology/approach: This study models the MCIN by node model definition, multi-agent architecture design and addressing method presentation. Findings: The prototype of novel E-commerce platform based on the MCIN shows the effectiveness and soundness of the MCIN modeling. By comparing to current internet, the authors also find that the MCIN has the advantages of socialization, information integration, collective intelligence, traceability, high robustness, unification of producing and consuming, high scalability and decentralization. Research limitations/implications: Leveraging the dimensions of structure, character, knowledge and experience, a modeling approach of the basic information can fit all kinds of the MCIN nodes. With the double chain structure for both basic and supply–demand information, the MCIN nodes can be modeled comprehensively. The anima-desire-intention-based multi-agent architecture makes the federated agents of the MCIN nodes self-organized and intelligent. The MCIN nodes can be efficiently addressed by the supply–demand-oriented method. However, the implementation of the MCIN is still in process. Practical implications: This paper lays the theoretical foundation for the future networked system of supply–demand relationship and the novel E-commerce platform. Originality/value: The authors believe that the MCIN, first proposed in this paper, is a transformational innovation which facilitates the infrastructure of the future networked system of supply–demand relationship. © 2017, Jianping Shen, Yadong Huang and Yueting Chai.","Cyber physics social system; E-commerce; Multi-agent; Supply-demand relationship",,,"Shen, J.; Department of Automation, China; email: shenjianping@tsinghua.edu.cn","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",23987294,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030467253

Recent scholarship on labour standards in supply chains emphasises the need for complementarity between public and private forms of governance, and the importance of local contexts in shaping compliance outcomes. This paper, in contrast, argues that the distinction between public and private governance belies the complex interaction of regulatory forms and industry dynamics in global production networks. It develops this argument via an analysis of the International Labour Organisation Better Work programme, which, over the last decade, has metamorphosed from a country-specific monitoring programme into a unique model of hybrid governance that has been implemented in a half dozen countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Drawing from field research conducted on Nicaragua’s Better Work programme, it examines the achievements and limitations of hybrid governance, and proposes that these can best be understood when the global value chain for apparel is seen as a transnational field within which relational struggles between different stakeholders at the global and national levels shape the political contexts within which particular governance solutions are pursued. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","global value chain; Governance; labor compliance; transnational field; transnational regulation","compliance; globalization; governance approach; international organization; labor standard; labor supply; regulatory framework; stakeholder; supply chain management; Africa; Asia; Latin America",,"Bair, J.; Department of Sociology, United States; email: jlb5md@virginia.edu","Routledge",13563467,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009274730

To seek a dynamic spare parts ordering and pricing policy from a distributor’s viewpoint, stochastic programming with multi-choice parameters is applied to formulate this objective optimization problem. In our model, the optimal objective is to maximize the total expected profit of the members of the spare parts supply network, and the decision variables are distributor’s selling price and ordering quantity in different periods. By using the methods of expectation operator of the fuzzy variable, Lagrange interpolating polynomial and global criteria, the model is solved, and the optimal ordering and pricing policy is obtained. The results of the numerical example and contrast experiments validate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed model. Some significant conclusions drawn from the results of parameter sensitivity analysis can be referred by management practitioners.

This research explores future value network configurations which, when aligned with disruptive shifts in technology (process and digital), may enable alternative routes to medicines production and the delivery of additional value to ‘end-users’, i.e. patients and health care providers. We draw on a categorisation of AMTs that may enable a shift from the traditional ‘batch’ and centralised manufacturing paradigm of ‘make-to-stock’, towards more re-distributed ‘continuous’ manufacturing and ‘make-to-order’ models. Despite reported benefits in the academic literature (e.g. reduced footprints, improved quality, enhanced flexibility and inventory savings), current adoption rates of continuous technologies in this sector remain low (c. 5%). This paper presents new data sources, in our study of AMT adoption in a global pharmaceutical context–assessing the barriers to implementation, and the pathways to delivering future continuous manufacturing scenarios.

Over the last forty years, the number of licensed distributors has declined, a trend accompanied by rising prices and a diminishing market supply of the psychoactive cactus. Distributors are recognized as the primary NAC peyote source; consequently, their disappearance would be devastating for the 250,000-plus adherents of this distinctive indigenous tradition. Based on interviews with current and former peyote distributors, peyote pickers, landowners, and NAC members, a map of the various commodity chains that make up the peyote supply network is constructed. This research applies Access Mapping and Access Analysis of the supply network to identify the primary factors driving the decline of the regulated peyote trade. Focusing on the distributors' and NAC members' rights-based, structural, and relational access mechanisms, avenues for increasing access are identified, including amendment of distributor licensing fees.

Meningococci adapt to diverse local host conditions differing in nutrient supply, like the nasopharynx, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid, by changing metabolism and protein repertoire. However, regulatory transcription factors and two-component systems in meningococci involved in adaptation to local nutrient variations are limited. We identified novel sibling small regulatory RNAs (Neisseria metabolic switch regulators [Nms Rs]) regulating switches between cataplerotic and anaplerotic metabolism in this pathogen. Overexpression of Nms Rs was tolerated in blood but not in cerebrospinal fluid. Expression of six tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes was downregulated by direct action of Nms Rs. Expression of the Nms Rs themselves was under the control of the stringent response through the action of Rel A. Small sibling regulatory RNAs of meningococci, controlling general metabolic switches, add an exciting twist to their versatile repertoire in bacterial pathogens. IMPORTANCE Regulatory small RNAs (s RNAs) of pathogens are coming to be recognized as highly important components of riboregulatory networks, involved in the control of essential cellular processes. They play a prominent role in adaptation to physiological changes as represented by different host environments. They can function as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression to orchestrate metabolic adaptation to nutrient stresses. Here, we identified highly conserved sibling s RNAs in Neisseria meningitidis which are functionally involved in the regulation of gene expression of components of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. These novel sibling s RNAs that function by antisense mechanisms extend the so-called stringent response which connects metabolic status to colonization and possibly virulence as well as pathogenesis in meningococci. © 2017 Pannekoek et al.","Metabolic regulation; Neisseria meningitidis; Pathogenesis; Sibling sRNAs; Small regulatory RNAs; Stringent response","adenosine triphosphate; bacterial RNA; Neisseria metabolic switch regulator; small regulatory RNA; unclassified drug; bacterial RNA; small untranslated RNA; 5' untranslated region; anaplerotic metabolism; Article; bacterial genome; bacterial growth; bacterial metabolism; bacterial strain; bacterial viability; bacterial virulence; bacterium transformation; cataplerotic metabolism; citric acid cycle; controlled study; disulfide bond; down regulation; enzyme regulation; gene cassette; gene expression regulation; gene frequency; mutagenesis; Neisseria meningitidis; nonhuman; plasmid; priority journal; protein protein interaction; protein synthesis; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA metabolism; single nucleotide polymorphism; transcription initiation site; gene expression regulation; gene regulatory network; genetics; metabolism; Neisseria meningitidis; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Regulatory Networks; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Neisseria meningitidis; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Small Untranslated",,"Pannekoek, Y.; Department of Medical Microbiology, Netherlands; email: y.pannekoek@amc.uva.nl","American Society for Microbiology",21612129,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019161611

The proposed model is applied to a real world case study and the numerical results are carefully analyzed and interpreted.

Due to increased governance through universal codes, standards and certification, Fairtrade risks becoming an abstract ethical and regulatory tool, disconnected from the moral economies of those poor farmers it is intended to benefit. In response, the paper makes a case for a deeper understanding of the moral economies of farmers involved in Fairtrade networks and the ways in which these emerge out of moral experiences that are deeply embedded in local social and cultural relations. Through a case study of Eksteenskuil Agricultural Cooperative in South Africa’s Northern Cape, it seeks to demonstrate the importance of understanding the moral experiences of producers to better consider what is at stake for them, focusing on notions of cooperation, fairness and the ‘good farmer’, perceptions of community, and concerns with survival and self-sufficiency. The paper concludes that working in culturally-sensitive ways with producer communities and understanding how their local moral worlds are structured is vital in bridging the gap between abstract ethical discourses and the place-based moral experiences of producers, and to ensuring the effectiveness of Fairtrade initiatives. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Cooperatives; ethics; Fairtrade; moral experience; South Africa","ethics; morality; smallholder; social movement; Northern Cape; South Africa",,"McEwan, C.; Department of Geography, Lower Mountjoy, South Road, United Kingdom; email: Cheryl.McEwan@durham.ac.uk","SAGE Publications Ltd",0308518X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012981975

Yet, while there has been a substantial body of work investigating supply chain networks, little research has paid attention to how the network structure affects the power balance between manufacturers and suppliers. This study investigates, from a power perspective, the role that network connectedness plays in new equity based joint venture formations. As such, we further the understanding of supply chain networks by examining network structure as a mechanism from which firms derive power. We articulate several hypotheses rooted in both network and power theories by specifically examining, from a power perspective, factors such as eigenvector centrality, closeness centrality, and weak components centrality. Further, we differentiate between horizontal and vertical joint venture configurations and elucidate the moderating effect it has in engendering new manufacturing joint venture formations. Empirical results show that structural network based power is a significant explanatory mechanism in new joint venture formation, and specifically, that power is, and should be a primary consideration in supply chain partnership decisions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Horizontal and vertical joint ventures; Joint venture networks; Network theory; Power; Supply chain management",,,"Carnovale, S.; Portland State University, 615 SW Harrison St., KMC 660K, United States; email: sc9@pdx.edu","Elsevier Ltd",14784092,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012906882

In multimodal transport networks it is well acknowledged the use of information and communication technology (ICT) can deliver benefits that include real time track and trace, visibility and reduced lead-time, among others. Given the importance of the benefits associated to the adoption of ICT in the operation of multimodal transport networks, this work uses institutional-related theories in a multiple-case study comprising seven seaports terminals located in two continents. The purpose of the study is to identify key elements that affect and influence the adoption of ICT to support interoperability and connectivity in multi-modal seaport terminal operations. The analysis is used to identify groupings of influence linked to elements comprising institutional-related theories like coercion and mimesis, part of institutional isomorphism, among others. The study shows that both government legislation and dominant organizations running ports in various geographical locations exert great influence regarding ICT adoption policies in seaport terminals. The adoption of ICT has become important given the proliferation of technologies, the increasing need for track and trace capabilities and the economic impact of seaports terminals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","ICT adoption; Institutional isomorphism; Multi-modality; Port research; Seaport logistics","Information use; Ports and harbors; Set theory; Supply chains; Geographical locations; Government legislations; Ict adoptions; Information and Communication Technologies; Institutional isomorphism; Multi modality; Multimodal transport; Multiple-case study; Multimodal transportation; information and communication technology; port operation; shipping; technology adoption; transportation development; transportation policy; transportation technology",,"Coronado Mondragon, A.E.; School of Management, United Kingdom; email: adrian.coronado@rhul.ac.uk","Elsevier Ltd",09658564,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010375996

The links between supply chain and industrial structure deserve better understanding. In this way, the industrial activities can be managed to change industrial structure from supply risk. We took the anthropogenic iron in Mainland China into our case study. The comprehensive evaluation was modeled to tackle the problems of China's iron and steel industry. From the life cycle perspective, we found that extending iron and steel supply chain would digest the oversupply and reduce the excessive emission, the main problems affecting on the steel ratio for electric arc furnaces were steel scrap shortage and relatively high electrovalence, and Fe content of the social stock basically resided in construction industry which significantly influenced on the flow of steel products and steel and iron products. More attention should be paid to the factors of export price, resource allocation efficiency, financing capability and outdated capacity, strict inspection and prevention should be taken to these risks. A comprehensive picture of several customized risk reduction strategies was constructed for those problems. Of the strategies, China’ risks of iron and steel industry could be reduced if the existing industrial structure were adjusted on the basis of the substance flow networks and global iron and steel industrial chains. Based on the result, recommendations were made in this paper, aiming to contribute important reference information for the industrial metabolism, resource management, and recycling of iron and steel industry in Mainland China. The proposed methodology, integrating suppliers’ risk evaluation based on supply chain and substance flow analysis offers a quick and convenient examination on more comprehensive risk reduction alternatives. Further dedicated risk evaluation might be required to estimate the more precise risks for the iron and steel industries or other industries that were pre-identified as the outdated. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Industrial structure; Iron and steel; Substance flow analysis; Supplier’ risk evaluation; Supply chain","Construction industry; Electric arcs; Electric furnaces; Information management; Iron; Iron scrap; Life cycle; Resource allocation; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Scrap metal reprocessing; Steel scrap; Steelmaking; Supply chains; Allocation efficiencies; Comprehensive evaluation; Industrial activities; Industrial structures; Iron and steel; Life cycle perspectives; Risk evaluation; Substance flow analysis; Iron and steel industry; environmental economics; environmental risk; industrial structure; iron and steel industry; life cycle analysis; subsurface flow; supply chain management; China","CGS: [2015] 05-03-05-019","An, R.China; email: tina25790@qq.com","Elsevier Ltd",03014207,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010300494

One effective method to reduce industry environmental footprint is the use of a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). The decision concerning the design and planning of an optimal network of the CLSC plays a vital role in determining the total carbon footprint across the supply chain and also the total cost. In this context, this research proposes an optimization model for design and planning a multi-period, multi-product CLSC with carbon footprint consideration under two different uncertainties. The demand and returns uncertainties are considered by means of multiple scenarios and uncertainty of carbon emissions due to supply chain related activities are considered by means of bounded box set and solve using robust optimization approach. The model extends further to investigate the impact of different carbon policies such as including strict carbon cap, carbon tax, carbon cap-and-trade, and carbon offset on the supply chain strategic and operational decisions. The model captures trade-offs that exist among supply chain total cost and carbon emissions. Also, the proposed model optimizes both supply chain total cost and carbon emissions across the supply chain activities. The numerical results reveal some insightful observations with respect to CLSC strategic design decisions and carbon emissions under various carbon policies and at the end we highlighted some managerial insights. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Carbon policies; Closed-loop supply chain network design; Mathematical modelling; Robust optimization; Stochastic programming; Transportation mode selection","Climate change; Commerce; Costs; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Mathematical models; Optimization; Product design; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Carbon emissions; Carbon policy; Closed-loop supply chain network designs; Robust optimization; Transportation mode; Carbon footprint; carbon emission; environmental economics; mathematical analysis; network design; optimization; stochasticity; trade-off; transportation mode; uncertainty analysis",,"Mohammed, F.; Department of Materials, 81310 UTM Skudai, Malaysia; email: fareeduddinm@gmail.com","Elsevier Ltd",13619209,,TRDTF,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009874268

However, many advanced technologies have the potential to reduce material and energy consumption in upstream or downstream processing stages. In order to fully understand the benefits and consequences of technology deployment, next-generation technologies should be evaluated in context, as part of a supply chain. This work presents the Materials Flow through Industry (MFI) supply chain modeling tool. The MFI tool is a cradle-to-gate linear network model of the US industrial sector that can model a wide range of manufacturing scenarios, including changes in production technology and increases in industrial energy efficiency. The MFI tool was developed to perform supply chain scale analyses in order to quantify the impacts and benefits of next-generation technologies and materials at that scale. For the analysis presented in this paper, the MFI tool is utilized to explore a case study comparing three lightweight vehicle supply chains to the supply chain of a conventional, standard weight vehicle. Several of the lightweight vehicle supply chains are evaluated under manufacturing scenarios that include next-generation production technologies and next-generation materials. Results indicate that producing lightweight vehicles is more energy and emission intensive than producing the non-lightweight vehicle, but the fuel saved during vehicle use offsets this increase. In this case study, greater reductions in supply chain energy and emissions were achieved through the application of the next-generation technologies than from application of energy efficiency increases. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Energy efficiency; Manufacturing; Materials; Supply chain modeling","commodity; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy use; industrial emission; manufacturing; modeling; processing; supply chain management; transport vehicle; United States","NSF: 1632975; USDOE; AMO","Hanes, R.J.; National Renewable Energy LaboratoryUnited States; email: rebecca.hanes@nrel.gov","Springer New York LLC",21945403,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009168916

From its initial function of a point of transit, Panama became a tollbooth with the setting of the Panama Canal mostly servicing intercoastal networks. Then, with the growth of transpacific trade and increasing ship sizes Panama became a major transshipment hub, a process facilitated by reforms of its port governance with setting of a landlord port authority model and concessions to private terminal operators. With the emergence of Panama as a logistics platform, governance has gone beyond the realm of the port. The setting of a national Logistics Cabinet in 2014 is illustrative of that trend aiming at coordinating the operations of the Panama Canal (with its expanded locks), port activities focusing on transshipment and the setting of port centric logistics zones. Still, the intermediary location of Panama is facing some risk in the post expansion era since shipping lines are no longer forced to use Panama and could elect for other transshipment hubs. In light of the emerging commercial context, it remains to be seen how the connectivity of Panama will fit within global supply chain strategies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Panama Canal; Port governance; Transshipment hub",,,,"Elsevier Ltd",22105395,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006992428

The scientific focus and challenge in simulations move from understanding system complexity to actually prototyping online and distributed regulatory mechanisms for supporting system operations. Existing simulation tools are not designed to address the challenges of this new reality, however, simulation is all about capturing reality at an adequate level of detail. This paper fills this gap by introducing a Java-based distributed simulation framework for inter-connected and inter-dependent techno-socio-economic system: SFINA, the Simulation Framework for Intelligent Network Adaptations. Three layers outline the design approach of SFINA: (i) integration of domain knowledge and dynamics that govern various techno-socio-economic systems, (ii) system modeling with dynamic flow networks represented by temporal directed weighted graphs and (iii) simulation of generic regulation models, policies and mechanisms applicable in several domains. SFINA aims at minimizing the fragmentation and discrepancies between different simulation communities by allowing the interoperability of SFINA with several other existing domain backends. The coupling of three such backends with SFINA is illustrated in the domain of Smart Grids and disaster mitigation. It is shown that the same model of cascading failures in Smart Grids is developed once and evaluated with both MATPOWER and InterPSS backends without changing a single line of application code. Similarly, application code developed in SFINA is reused for the evaluation of mitigation strategies in a backend that simulates the flows of a disaster spread. Results provide a proof-of-concept for the high modularity and reconfigurability of SFINA and puts the foundations of a new generation of simulation tools that prototype and validate online decentralized regulation in techno-socio-economic systems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Agent; Cascading failure; Distributed system; Flow network; Framework; Inter-dependent networks; Simulation; Techno-socio-economic system","Agents; Complex networks; Disasters; Distributed database systems; Electric power transmission networks; Flow graphs; Food supply; Intelligent networks; Online systems; Smart power grids; Supply chains; Cascading failures; Distributed systems; Flow network; Framework; Simulation; Socio-economic systems; Computer software",,"Pournaras, E.; Computational Social Science, Switzerland; email: epournaras@ethz.ch","Elsevier B.V.",1569190X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006726022

In the Philippines, a national policy has been in place since 2010, which regulates the quality of seedlings. As part of the policy, government reforestation programs are required to use only high quality seedlings from accredited seedling suppliers. A survey of nurseries producing seedlings for the National Greening Program in Eastern Visayas and Northern Mindanao regions was carried out to determine the effectiveness and challenges in implementing the forest nursery accreditation policy. The survey identified factors that limit the effectiveness of seedling quality regulation including lack of auditing of seedling quality in accredited nurseries, insufficient monitoring of the seedling supply chain among the network of nurseries supplying seedlings for reforestation programs, inadequate seedling production schedules, and inappropriate criteria for seedling quality assessment. The limited sources of high quality germplasm, nursery operators’ limited information on the attributes of high quality planting materials and lack of knowledge about high quality seedling production technologies contributed to the widespread production of low quality seedlings. The lack of seedling quality checks makes the government’s bidding scheme of seedling purchases prone to favouring the proliferation of low quality seedlings that are usually sold at lower prices. Nursery accreditation represents a major initiative in promoting the success of Philippine reforestation but our study found that considerable improvement of the policy and of its implementation is necessary. From our study, key lessons can be learned for the implementation of forest landscape restoration initiatives in other tropical developing countries. © 2016, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.","FLR; Forest landscape restoration; Forest restoration; Nursery accreditation; Planting stock; Reforestation policy; Seedling morphology; Seedling quality","developing world; environmental restoration; forestry policy; policy implementation; reforestation; seedling; supply chain management; Eastern Visayas; Northern Mindanao; Philippines","ACIAR: ASEM/2011/050","Gregorio, N.; Tropical Forests and People Research Centre, Australia; email: ngregori@usc.edu.au","Springer Netherlands",18737617,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978771852

Methods Three clinical communities (spine, joint, blood management) and one clinical community-like physician led team of surgeon stakeholders partnered with the supply chain team on specific supply cost initiatives. The teams reviewed their specific utilization and cost data, and the physicians led consensus-building conversations over a series of team meetings to agree to standard supply utilization. Results The spine and joint clinical communities each agreed upon a vendor capping model that led to cost savings of $3 million dollars and $1.5 million dollars respectively. The blood management decreased blood product utilization and achieved $1.2 million dollars savings. $5.6 million dollars in savings was achieved by a clinical community-like group of surgeon stakeholders through standardization of sutures and endomechanicals. Conclusions Physician led clinical teams empowered to lead change achieved substantial supply chain cost savings in an academic health system. The model of combining clinical communities with supply chain offers hope for an effective, practical, and scalable approach to improving value and engaging physicians in other academic health systems. Implications This clinician led model could benefit both private and academic health systems engaging in value optimization efforts.

The proposed MOP includes three conflicting objectives: maximization of total profit, minimization of supply disruption and opportunism risks, and minimization of carbon emission considering a number of supply chain constraints. Furthermore, this research analyses the effect of social relationship levels between different tiers of SCN on the profitability, risk, and emission over the time. In this regard, we focus on responding to the following questions. (1) How does the evolving social relationship affect the objectives of the supply chain (SC)? (2) How do the upstream firms’ relationships affect the relationships of downstream firms, and how these relationships influence the objectives of the SC? (3) How does the supply disruption risk interact with the opportunism risk through supply chain relationships, and how these risks affect the objectives of the SC? (4) How do these three conflicting objectives trade-off?

As an alternative, this research first treats the DEDA problem by the augmented Lagrangian dual (ALD) method as the singly constrained entropy distribution/assignment (SEDA) problem, which in turn is addressed, via a tactical supernetwork representation, as an “extended” 1-origin-to-1-destination TA problem. A quick-precision TA solution algorithm, − called TAPAS (Traffic Assignment by Paired Alternative Segments), − is then adopted for solutions. The proposed approach is demonstrated with a numerical example for the correctness of the result, using Lingo 11 solver and the partial linearization solution (PLS) algorithm. Moreover, through the use of TAPAS in the innermost loop, the proposed approach also has the merit of generating unique path flow solution, which is very useful in route guidance under the intelligent transportation systems environment, among other academic applications.

Considering uncertainty in travel times for vehicle routing problems is beneficial because more robust schedules can be generated and unanticipated consequences can be reduced when schedules are implemented in reality. However, uncertainties in model parameters have rarely been addressed for the problems in this category mainly due to the high problem complexity. In this study, an innovative and practical approach is proposed to consider stochastic travel times in the planning process. In the planning model, the possible outcomes of vehicle arrivals and product delivery at retailers are systematically categorized and their associated penalty and reward are estimated. Thus, unanticipated costs for every scheduling decision can be incorporated into the planning model to generate vehicle routing schedules that are more robust facing uncertain traffic conditions. To solve the model that is characterized as an NP-hard problem in a reasonable amount of time, a two-stage heuristic solution algorithm is proposed. Finally, the stochastic model is compared with the deterministic model in both planning and simulated operation stages using the data of a supply chain in Taiwan. The result confirms that the schedule generated by the stochastic model is more robust than the one created with the deterministic model because undesired outcomes such as unfulfilled demands are greatly reduced. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Heuristic; Multi-trip split-delivery; Stochastic travel time; Time-space network; Vehicle routing problem with time windows","Complex networks; Computational complexity; Network routing; Routing algorithms; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Travel time; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Heuristic; Split delivery; Stochastic travel time; Time-space networks; Vehicle routing problem with time windows; Stochastic models","MOST","Yan, S.; Department of Civil Engineering, No. 300, Jhongda Rd., Taiwan; email: t320002@cc.ncu.edu.tw","Springer New York LLC",1566113X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952005390

It is always a tough decision to select an optimal route in the stages of a supply chain that will balance the reverse condition of cost and time.

The complexity of design for perishable inventory is due to the limited lifetime of these products that restricts their duration and condition of storage. Further, under some circumstances such as unusual weather condition or malfunction of transportation and storage facilities, the expected lifetime of products may fluctuate and make the situations more complicated. This study, therefore, develops a model for network design of perishable items, and takes into account the uncertainty of products lifetime. Since many uncertain parameters are difficult to be defined by known probability distribution functions, the developed model of this study deals with the uncertainty of lifetime by defining worst-case scenarios. The model determines the configuration and inventory control policy of the network concerning the defined scenarios. A Lagrangian relaxation-based heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the model. © 2016 Chinese Institute of Industrial Engineers.","algorithms; heuristics and meta-heuristics; Probabilistic inventory models; supply chain management","Algorithms; Complex networks; Distribution functions; Heuristic algorithms; Inventory control; Probability distributions; Supply chain management; Uncertainty analysis; Inventory control policies; Inventory models; LaGrangian relaxation; Meta heuristics; Perishable inventory; Supply chain network design; Uncertain parameters; Worst case scenario; Product design",,"Firoozi, Z.; Department of Industrial Engineering, Iran; email: zhr_firoozi@yahoo.com","Taylor and Francis Ltd.",21681015,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991031101

We also investigate the applications of the new concept to the design of regional biomass supply chains and solving vehicle routing problems. In designing a supply chain, the values of the distance potentials are used to determine the precedence order: the demand point with the largest distance potential value will be satisfied first. While satisfying a demand point, the source point with the shortest distance to the demand will be used first. In solving a vehicle routing problem, the new concept is used to identify the customer which should be included in the first routing to be considered. Then, the network can be designed starting from the customer identified, and based on a few heuristic rules proposed in this paper.

The Internet of Things (IoT) involves connections of physical things to the Internet. It is largely about the relationships between things, or non-humans actors. In other cases the 'Things' seem to have inordinate power. The authors will ask: Where does this leave humans? Are the things taking over? As a consideration of interactions like this must be a socio-technical one, in this article the authors will make use of Actor-Network Theory to frame the discussion. While the original applications for IoT technology were in areas such as supply chain management and logistics, now many more examples can be found ranging from control of home appliances to healthcare. It is expected that the 'Things' will become active participants in business, information and social processes and that they will communicate among themselves by exchanging data sensed from the environment, while reacting autonomously. The Things will continue to develop identities and virtual personalities. In the past non-human actors have needed humans to interact with each other, but this is not the case anymore. In this perhaps provocative and rather speculative article we will look not just at the Internet of Things, but other related concepts such as artificial intelligence and robotics and make use of scenarios from science fiction to investigate the Rise of the Non-Human Actors and where this may lead in the future. © 2017 by IGI Global.

In response to the dramatic changes in the business landscape over the last few years, many companies are launching business transformation programs to drive sweeping changes in their supply chain processes. These transformations are required to match the ever-growing customer demand and drive competition in the market. The supply chain transformation can be evident in exploring new sourcing networks, establishing collaborative forecasting processes, optimizing networks and inventories, reducing supply chain complexities, improving margins, etc. In today's world, it is no longer an option whether or not to opt for supply chain business transformations. Instead, it is a strategic mandate in order to stay relevant in the industry.

Traditionally, EC focuses on solving a single optimization task at a time. However, in complex multi-echelon supply chain networks (SCNs), there usually exist various kinds of PCOPs at the same time, e.g., travel salesman problem (TSP), job-shop scheduling problem (JSP), etc. So, it is desirable to solve several PCOPs at once with both effectiveness and efficiency. Very recently, a new paradigm in EC, namely, multifactorial optimization (MFO) has been introduced to explore the potential of evolutionary multitasking, which can serve the purpose of simultaneously optimizing multiple PCOPs in SCNs. In this paper, the evolutionary multitasking of PCOPs is studied. In particular, based on a recently proposed multitasking engine known as the multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA), two novel mechanisms, namely, a new unified representation and a new survivor selection procedure, are introduced to better adapt to PCOPs. Experimental results obtained on well-known benchmark problems not only show the benefits of the two new mechanisms but also verify the promise of evolutionary multitasking for PCOPs. In addition, the results on a test case involving four optimization tasks demonstrate the potential scalability of evolutionary multitasking to many-task environments. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Combinatorial optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; Job shop scheduling; Optimization; Supply chains; Bench-mark problems; Combinatorial optimization problems; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Job shop scheduling problems; Multi echelon supply chains; Optimization task; Selection procedures; Travel salesman problems (TSP); Multitasking",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509025961,85QXA,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015402386

However, sewer pipes deteriorate, and their accumulated structural defects may release untreated wastewater to the environment via acute breaks or insidious exfiltration. Exfiltrated wastewater constitutes a loss of potentially reusable water and delivers a complex and variable mix of contaminants to urban shallow groundwater. Yet, predicting where deteriorated sewers impinge on shallow groundwater has been challenging. Here we develop and test a spatially explicit model of exfiltration probability based on pipe attributes and groundwater elevation without prior knowledge of exfiltrating defect locations. We find that models of exfiltration probability can predict the probable occurrence in underlying shallow groundwater of established wastewater indicators including the artificial sweetener acesulfame, tryptophan-like fluorescent dissolved organic matter, nitrate, and a stable isotope of water (δ18O). The strength of the association between exfiltration probability and indicators of wastewater increased when multiple pipe attributes, distance weighting, and groundwater flow direction were considered in the model. The results prove that available sanitary sewer databases and groundwater digital elevation data can be analyzed to predict where pipes are likely leaking and contaminating groundwater. Such understanding could direct sewer infrastructure reinvestment toward water resource protection. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Amino acids; Biological materials; Defects; Forecasting; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Investments; Probability; Sewers; Sugar substitutes; Water quality; Water resources; Artificial sweeteners; Digital elevation data; Dissolved organic matters; Groundwater elevations; Groundwater flow directions; Municipal wastewaters; Spatially explicit modeling; Water resource protection; Groundwater pollution; acesulfame; dissolved organic matter; drinking water; ground water; nitrate; stable isotope; sweetening agent; tryptophan; ground water; waste water; water pollutant; database; digital elevation model; groundwater; groundwater flow; groundwater-surface water interaction; leakage; municipal solid waste; pipe; sewer network; shallow water; stable isotope; twentieth century; urban area; wastewater; water resource; Article; atomic emission spectrometry; contamination; environmental health; feces analysis; fluorescence spectroscopy; geographic information system; mass fragmentography; polymerase chain reaction; public health; risk assessment; sewage; sewer; tandem mass spectrometry; topography; urban area; waste water; waste water management; water quality; water sampling; water supply; water table; water treatment; chemistry; sewage; theoretical model; water pollutant; United States; Groundwater; Models, Theoretical; Sweetening Agents; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,"Holden, P.A.; Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, United States; email: holden@bren.ucsb.edu","American Chemical Society",0013936X,,ESTHA,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020291216

But, synthesis of long-chain macromolecules needed to support higher-order functions in living systems (e.g., polypeptides, proteins, and nucleic acids) cannot occur without enrichment of chemical precursors before initiating polymerization, and identifying a suitable mechanism has become a key unanswered question in the origin of life. Here, we apply simulations and in situ experiments to show how 3D chaotic thermal convection-flows that naturally permeate hydrothermal pore networks-supplies a robust mechanism for focused accumulation at discrete targeted surface sites. This interfacial enrichment is synchronized with bulk homogenization of chemical species, yielding two distinct processes that are seemingly opposed yet synergistically combine to accelerate surface reaction kinetics by several orders of magnitude.

The SCRM literature seems to require studies that utilize risk typology, sources of risk, etc. for reviewing the topic. The purpose of this paper is to bridge the gap by synthesizing the information obtained from 343 articles across 85 journals. This study also presents a critical analysis of the content of SCRM in a structured manner to identify the directions for future research. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) was devised and adopted, which involved the selection, classification, and evaluation of 343 research articles published over a period of 11 years (2004-2014). The content of extant SCRM literature was critically analyzed and synthesized from the perspective of the risk management process (RMP). Findings: The analysis of extant literature shows that there is a marked rise in research in the SCRM area, especially after the year 2005. It was observed that not only risk but also different forms of uncertainties make supply chain (SC) operations difficult to manage. The SCRM actions yielded most benefits when their implementation was at chain or network level and managed strategically. The analysis also reveals that the manufacturing sector is most affected by risks and highly investigated by researchers. Practical implications: A complete process for SCRM based on risk stratification, objectives of risk management, and RMP will be a guiding model for firms to manage risks. The research gaps identified and future directions provided here will encourage researchers and managers to devise new methods, tools, and techniques to address the risks in modern SC operations. Originality/value: An SLR and risk-based content classification of SCRM literature were performed. To identify, locate, select, and analyze the SCRM literature, a structured and systematic process was adopted with some very rarely used methods such as two levels of search keywords, and strings were formulated to locate the most relevant articles in major academic databases. © 2017, 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Content analysis; Risk management; Risk management process; Supply chain management; Systematic literature review",,,"Soni, G.; Mechanical Engineering Department, India; email: gunjan1980@gmail.com","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09727981,,,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040632984

According to the characteristics, the potency of deterioration and cross contamination along the chain will be a challenge for every actor in tuna supply chain, to provide tuna product with the best quality and safe to consume. One of the tool to ensure the standard safety and quality is doing traceability system along tuna supply chain. It is very crucial because every actor in chain has a responsibility to ensure food safety and quality through handling, manufacturing, packaging, and transporting the product. The critical point that should be covered by traceability system in tuna supply chain includes temperature, content of histamine, quantity of TPC, and contents of bacterial pathogens like Salmonella, and the sanitation for workers, equipment and processing room. The Information Technology (IT) based tuna traceability system is proposed and discussed in this paper to optimizing the traceability system in tuna supply chain. This paper discusses the development of a traceability system architecture and prototype for tuna supply chains. The developed system prototype shows the functional capabilities required for backward and forward tracing of tuna fish transformation and movement along the chain involving many actors (from fishing vessels to retailers). The system also permits the monitoring of processes and products based on microbiological analysis and on existing SOPs owned by some actors in a tuna supply chain.

However, actual completion time always deviated from the standard completion time due to unavoidable factors and consequently affect delivery due date and ultimately lead to customer dissatisfaction. Besides, it is found that little attention has been given in analysing completion time at production line from previous literatures. Therefore, this paper fill the knowledge gap by predicting completion time based on historical data of production line activities and discovers the most influential factor that contributes to the tardiness or a late job's due date from its completion time. A wellknown company in producing audio speaker is selected as a case company. Based on the review of previous works, it is found that Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) has superior capability in prediction of future occurrence by capturing the underlying relationship among variables through historical data. Besides, ANN is also capable to provide final weight for each of related variable. Variable with the highest value of final weight indicates the most influential variable and should be concerned more to solve completion time issue which has persisted among entities in supply chain system. The obtained result is expected to become an advantageous guidance for every entity in supply chain system to fulfil completion time requirement as requested by customer in order to survive in this turbulent market place. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","ANN; Completion time; Data mining; Production line",,"UUM; MOHE","Ahmarofi, A.A.; University Utara Malaysia (UUM), Malaysia; email: afif_ahmarofi@ahsgs.uum.edu.my","ExcelingTech",20513771,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030529826

As the economic value and environmental influences of different kinds of coals could be remarkably diverse, the separation of coal categories in systematic analysis could provide fundamental information regarding the displacement and teleconnection of coal utilization in the world. The estimation shows that in weight 64.99% of coal direct supply is ultimately embodied in international trade, indicating the crucial roles of trade interlinks in global coal utilization.

Accompanying this trend, an NFV market is emerging, where NFV service providers create VNF instances, assemble VNF service chains, and sell them for the use of customers, using resources (computing, bandwidth) that they own or rent from other resource suppliers. Efficient service chain provisioning and pricing mechanisms are still missing, to charge assembled service chains according to demand and the supply of resources at any time. We propose an online stochastic auction mechanism for on-demand service chain provisioning and pricing at an NFV provider. Our auction takes in buy bids for service chains from multiple customers and sell bids from various resource suppliers to supplement the NFV provider's geo-distributed resource pool, with resource occupation/contribution durations. We extend online primal-dual optimization framework for handling both buyers and sellers, with a new competitive analysis. The online mechanism maximizes the expected social welfare of the NFV ecosystem (the NFV provider, customers and resource suppliers) with a good competitive ratio as compared with the expected offline optimal social welfare, while guaranteeing truthfulness in bidding, individual rationality for both buyers and sellers, and polynomial time for computation. We evaluate our mechanism through trace-driven simulation studies, and demonstrate a close-to-offline-optimal performance in expected social welfare under realistic settings. © 1983-2012 IEEE.","Auction mechanism design; network functions virtualization; online algorithms","Chains; Commerce; Machine design; Polynomial approximation; Sales; Stochastic systems; Transfer functions; Virtual reality; Auction mechanisms; Competitive analysis; Distributed resources; Individual rationality; Network functions; On-line algorithms; Optimal performance; Trace driven simulation; Network function virtualization",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",07338716,,ISACE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017291126

Complex supply chains for the production of goods have resulted in an increasingly connected International Trade Network (ITN). Traditionally, direct trade relations between industries have been regarded as mediators of supply and demand spillovers. With increasing network connectivity the question arises if higher-order relations become more important in explaining a national sector’s susceptibility to supply and demand changes of its trading partner. In this study we address this question by investigating empirically to what extent the topological properties of the ITN provide information about positive correlations in the production of two industry sectors. We observe that although direct trade relations between industries serve as important indicators for correlations in the industries’ value added growth, opportunities of substitution for required production inputs as well as second-order trade relations cannot be neglected. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the relation between trade and economic productivity and can serve as a basis for the improvement of crisis spreading models that evaluate contagion threats in the case of a node’s failure in the ITN. © 2017, EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Commerce; Complex networks; Economics; Supply chains; Topology; Complex supply chain; Economic productivity; Network connectivity; Positive correlations; Statistical and Nonlinear Physics; Supply and demand; Topological properties; Value added growth; International trade",,"Maluck, J.; Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact ResearchGermany; email: Julian.Maluck@pik-potsdam.de","Springer Heidelberg",14346028,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013395174

The supply with sufficient energetic substrates to all brain cells, which are very densely packed, in particular in the human brain, is a huge logistic challenge. The most important energy substrate for our brain is glucose, which reaches the brain via the blood circulation. Glucose is not only utilized by nerve cells directly, but to a large extent also taken up by glial cells, which then either store glucose after conversion to glycogen as energy reserve, or transfer it as lactate to nerve cells. Lactate in nerve cells can then be converted to pyruvate, which is efficiently utilized together with oxygen for the formation of chemical energy in form of ATP. The intermediate metabolic product lactate hence plays an important role as energetic substrate, which is exchanged between cells both under aerobic and non-aerobic conditions. Transport of lactate across the cell membrane is carried out in co-transport with protons (H+), which are crucial regulators of various metabolic processes and membrane transporters. In addition, the lactate carriers form a functional network with carbonic anhydrases, enzymes, which not only catalyze the equilibrium between carbon dioxide, hydrogen carbonate (bicarbonate) and protons, but also facilitate lactate transport. In this article, we focus on physiological processes of the energy metabolism in glial cells as well as on the transfer of energetic substrates to nerve cells, processes, which themselves are critically modulated by pH and its regulation in glial cells.","Carbonic anhydrases; Lactate; Membrane transport; PH; Sugar","carbonate dehydratase; lactic acid; medium chain triacylglycerol; sugar; Article; astrocyte; brain; energy metabolism; energy resource; glia cell; human; neuromodulation; nonhuman; pH; physiological process",,"Deitmer, J.W.; Fachbereich Biologie, Postfach 3049, Germany; email: deitmer@bio.uni-kl.de","Elsevier GmbH",09470875,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013304727

In addition to rock fragmentation, blasting has a significant role in exerting inner damage and reducing the strength of rock fragments. The strength reduction facilitates many of downstream mining processes including comminution and reduces energy consumption in crushing and grinding stages, which is an important achievement in today’s environment. This study aims to investigate the effect of changing the explosive type on post-blast strength of rock fragments and their microcracks content and energy consumption in subsequent processes. For this purpose, several experimental blastings have been carried out using three types of explosives, ANFO, Emulite and pentolite, while the applied energy and other parameter were kept constant. Then, the P-wave velocity and point load index of rock fragments have been measured for all blasts. In the next step, microcrack density of rock fragments was measured by image processing of fluorescent microscopic images and also the quantity of all kinds of microcracks was examined by some light microscopy techniques. The results showed that rock fragments strength is totally influenced by explosive types, so that blasting with pentolite causes a 16.5% reduction in rock strength. Besides, it was found that the rock fragments strength is highly correlated with explosives detonation velocity (VOD). Furthermore, microcracks studies results showed that different types of explosive have dissimilar influences on rock microcrack network, so that the use of pentolite instead of ANFO increases the microcracks density more than 300%. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Explosives; Microcrack; Rock fragments; Strength; VOD","Blasting; Crushing; Detonation; Energy utilization; Grinding (comminution); Image processing; Microcracking; Microcracks; Rock bursts; Rocks; Seismic waves; Supply chains; Tungsten ore treatment; Video on demand; Wave propagation; Blasting operations; Micro-crack density; Microscopy technique; Rock fragmentation; Rock fragments; Strength; Strength reduction; Sustainable mining; Explosives; blasting; crushing; explosive; grinding; image processing; microcrack; mineral processing; mining; P-wave; strength; wave velocity",,"Bagherpour, R.; Department of Mining Engineering, Iran; email: Bagherpour@cc.iut.ac.ir","Springer Verlag",18666280,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013214734

Innovative technologies and concepts for urban water and wastewater systems already exist, but so far they have only been implemented in pilot projects, mainly as the result of the institutional barriers they face. So how can urban water transformation be encouraged? Qualitative expert interviews, a literature analysis and a series of workshops involving representatives from utilities and stakeholders involved in urban planning were undertaken to identify the key obstacles and encourage action. The current challenges facing the implementation of innovative urban water systems include sector-focused planning approaches, path dependencies (such as technological and “mental” barriers), legal and institutional constraints, and complex structures of responsibilities. New institutional arrangements involving the key players (cooperation models) as well as new processes requiring a reallocation of labour could contribute to a smoother implementation. Innovative water systems present new strategic opportunities for water utilities. Two opportunities that are worthy of consideration in order to fully exploit the benefits of such systems are a strengthening of the water–energy link and an intensification of activities along the “water chain”.

It aims to form a systematic solution including facility location and capacity design, supply plan, production plan and delivery plan. The uncertainty of demand is described by means of scenario approach. Following with multiple criteria evaluation, the optimal objective is the weighted sum of total cost, variance of total cost and penalty cost of inventory shortage. Limits of supply and delivery distance are incorporated in the proposed model. The supply limits include two parts, where the minimum supply quantity from an arbitrary supplier to its customers is regulated, and the demand from a downstream node may be satisfied by at least two upstream suppliers. The delivery distance limit is regulated that a distribution center’s distribution radius should be proportional to its capacity. Several important conclusions are drawn through numerical sample tests. First, the proposed method ensures a robust supply chain network with an ability of risk mitigation. Second, a reasonable distribution radius limit in a DC is beneficial for intensive logistics management. Finally, the trade-off between minimal inventory shortage and total supply chain cost should be reached by adjusting penalty weight. © 2017 ICIC International.","Delivery distance; Robust optimization; Supply; Supply chain network design",,"J13LN80; ZR2011GL006","Chen, J.; School of Traffic and Logistics Engineering, No. 5, Jiaoxiao Road, Tianqiao District, China; email: chenjl@sdjtu.edu.cn","ICIC Express Letters Office",1881803X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011649727

As a result, the traditional lines between engineering and the social sciences are becoming increasingly blurred, and analytical tools such as game theory are finding new applications in engineering [2], [3]. It is often insufficient to judge an engineered system on its technical merits alone since strategic user behavior can lead to unpredictable and/or undesirable results [4]. Of particular importance to this article are socially integrated engineering problems in which users' strategic behavior has a significant impact on overall system performance. These types of systems appear in a variety of contexts in theory and practice; transportation networks [5], ride-sharing applications [6], [7], supply-chain management [8], cloud computing [9], and electric power grids [10] are immediate examples. A common problem in these settings is that individual user incentives may not be aligned with the objectives of the central planner. Thus, in addition to the technical challenges of a socially integrated engineering problem, an engineer may need to consider methods of influencing individual user behavior to effect positive change on aggregate system performance [11]. These behavior-influencing mechanisms often take the form of offering users a tradeoff between quality of service and monetary incentive. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Behavioral research; Computation theory; Electric power transmission networks; Game theory; Quality of service; Supply chain management; Electric power grids; Engineered systems; Influencing mechanisms; Integrated engineering; Strategic Behavior; Technical challenges; Theory and practice; Transportation network; Distributed computer systems","NSF: 1638214",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",1066033X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010465163

In the long term the supply risk is estimated to be critical. Germany is one of the major primary gallium producer, recycler of gallium from new scrap and GaAs wafer producer. Therefore, new concepts for a resource saving handling of gallium and appropriate recycling strategies have to be designed. This study focus on options for a possible recycling of gallium from waste electric and electronic equipment. To identify first starting points, a substance flow analysis was carried out for gallium applied in integrated circuits applied on printed circuit boards and for LEDs used for background lighting in Germany in 2012. Moreover, integrated circuits (radio amplifier chips) were investigated in detail to deduce first approaches for a recycling of such components. An analysis of recycling barriers was carried out in order to investigate general opportunities and risks for the recycling of gallium from chips and LEDs. Results show, that significant gallium losses arose in primary production and in waste management. 93 ± 11%, equivalent to 43,000 ± 4700 kg of the total gallium potential was lost over the whole primary production process until applied in electronic goods. The largest share of 14,000 ± 2300 kg gallium was lost in the production process of primary raw materials. The subsequent refining process was related to additional 6900 ± 3700 kg and the chip and wafer production to 21,700 ± 3200 kg lost gallium. Results for the waste management revealed only low collection rates for related end-of-life devices. Not collected devices held 300 ± 200 kg gallium. Due to the fact, that current waste management processes do not recover gallium, further 80 ± 10 kg gallium were lost. A thermal pre-treatment of the chips, followed by a manual separation allowed an isolation of gallium rich fractions, with gallium mass fractions up to 35%. Here, gallium loads per chip were between 0.9 and 1.3 mg. Copper, gold and arsenic were determined as well. Further treatment options for this gallium rich fraction were assessed. The conventional pyrometallurgical copper route might be feasible. A recovery of gold and gallium in combination with copper is possible due to a compatibility with this base-metal. But, a selective separation prior to this process is necessary. Diluted with other materials, the gallium content would be too low. The recycling of gallium from chips applied on printed circuit boards and LEDs used for background lighting is technically complex. Recycling barriers exist over the whole recycling chain. A forthcoming commercial implementation is not expected in nearer future. This applies in particular for chips carrying gallium. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Critical metals; Gallium; Material flow analysis; Recovery; Recycling; Recycling barriers; Substance flow analysis (SFA); Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)","Copper; Electric network analysis; Electronic equipment; Gallium; Gold; Integrated circuits; Light emitting diodes; Lighting; Metal analysis; Metal recovery; Oscillators (electronic); Printed circuit boards; Recovery; Recycling; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Scrap metal reprocessing; Semiconductor device manufacture; Semiconductor diodes; Silicon wafers; Waste treatment; Commercial implementation; Critical raw materials; Material flow analysis; Selective separation; Semiconductor technology; Substance flow analysis; Thermal pre-treatment; Waste electric and electronic equipments; Waste management; gallium; gallium; electronic equipment; electronic waste; gallium; metallurgy; recycling; waste management; Article; chemical analysis; electrical equipment; electronic waste; light emitting diode; materials handling; metal recovery; physical chemistry; physical parameters; process design; process optimization; product development; recycling; risk assessment; waste management; isolation and purification; mining; mobile phone; procedures; semiconductor; waste management; Germany; Cell Phones; Electronic Waste; Extraction and Processing Industry; Gallium; Recycling; Semiconductors; Waste Management",,"Ueberschaar, M.; Technische Universität Berlin, Sekr.

As Europe is about to generate 20% of its energy demand from Renewable Energy Sources (RES) by 2020, adequate RES integration and renewable energy storage throughout the entire food cold chain must properly be addressed. Scope and approach Refrigerated warehouses for chilled and frozen foods are large energy consumers and account for a significant portion of the global energy demand. Nevertheless, the opportunity for RES integration in the energy supply of large food storage facilities is often neglected. In situ power generation using RES permits capture of a large portion of virtually free energy, thereby reducing dramatically the running costs and carbon footprint, while enhancing the economic competitiveness. In that context, there exist promising engineering solutions to exploit various renewables in the food preservation sector, in combination with the emerging sustainability-enhancing technology of Cryogenic Energy Storage (CES). Key findings and conclusions Substantial research endeavours are driven by the noble objective to turn the Europe's Energy Union into the world's number one in renewable energies. Integrating RES, in synchrony with CES development and proper control, is capable of both strengthening the food refrigeration sector and improving dramatically the power grid balance and energy system sustainability. Hence, this article aims to familiarise stakeholders of the European and global food preservation industry with state-of-the-art knowledge, know-how, opportunities and professional achievements in the concerned field. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cryogenics; Energy storage; Food preservation; Low-carbon economy; Refrigerated warehousing; Renewable energy","Carbon footprint; Cryogenic energy storage; Cryogenics; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy storage; Food preservation; Fossil fuels; Free energy; Industrial refrigeration; Refrigeration; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Technology transfer; Warehouses; Economic competitiveness; Energy diversification; Integrate renewable energies; Low carbon economy; Refrigerated warehousing; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy storages; Food storage","H2020: 691761","Fikiin, K.; Technical University of Sofia, 8 Kliment Ohridski Blvd., Bulgaria; email: k.fikiin@tu-sofia.bg","Elsevier Ltd",09242244,,TFTEE,Note,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008716336

The bulk transportation and storage can significantly curtail the transit and storage losses of food grains, which leads to substantial cost savings. A mixed integer non-linear programming model (MINLP) is developed after studying the Indian wheat supply chain scenario, where the objective is to minimize the transportation, storage and operational cost of the food grain incurred for efficient transfer of wheat from producing states to consuming states. The cost minimization of Indian food grain supply chain is a very complex and challenging problem because of the involvement of the many entities and their constraints such as seasonal procurement, limited scientific storages, varying demand, mode of transportation and vehicle capacity constraints. To address this complex and challenging problem of food grain supply chain, we have proposed the novel variant of Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO) algorithm which combines the features of CRO and Tabu search (TS) and named it as a hybrid CROTS algorithm (Chemical reaction optimization combined with Tabu Search). The numerous problems with different sizes are solved using the proposed algorithm and obtained results have been compared with CRO. The comparative study reveals that the proposed CROTS algorithm offers a better solution in less computational time than CRO algorithm and the dominance of CROTS algorithm over the CRO algorithm is demonstrated through statistical analysis. © 2016","Chemical reaction optimization; Food grain supply chain; Mixed integer non-linear programming; Public distribution system; Transportation-storage problem","Chemical reactions; Complex networks; Costs; Grain (agricultural product); Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Supply chains; Tabu search; Transportation; Chemical-reaction optimizations; Comparative studies; Computational time; Distribution systems; Food grain; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Two-stage supply chains; Vehicle capacity constraints; Food storage",,"Tiwari, M.K.; Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, India; email: mkt09@hotmail.com","Elsevier Ltd",03608352,,CINDD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007552659

On the other hand, it has been increasingly becoming a demand to design a supply chain network considering the environmental impact as a new dimension as required by authorities in many countries. This paper describes a development of a product distribution planner for a three-echelon green meat supply chain (MSC) design in terms of issues including numbers and locations of facilities that should be opened in association with the product quantity flows. These issues were formulated into a fuzzy multi-objective programming model (FMOPM) with an aim to minimize the total cost of transportation and implementation, the amount of CO2 emissions in transportation and the distribution time of products from farms to abattoirs and from abattoirs to retailers, and maximize the average delivery rate in satisfying product quantity as requested by abattoirs and retailers. To optimize the four objectives simultaneously, three solution methods were investigated and used; which are the LP-metrics method, the ε-constraint method and the goal programming method. The best solution was determined using the Max-Min method by comparing the obtained Pareto solutions. A case study was examined based on the developed model that demonstrates its applicability in making an optimal product distribution plan in trade-offs among the four objectives. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Distribution plan; Food supply chain design; Fuzzy multi-objective programming; Green supply chain; RFID","Carbon dioxide; Complex networks; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Food supply; Linear programming; Multiobjective optimization; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Supply chains; Cost of transportation; Distribution plan; Epsilon-constraint method; Goal programming; Green supply chain; Multiobjective programming; Product distributions; Supply chain network; Product design",,"Mohammed, A.; School of Engineering, United Kingdom; email: ahmed.mohammed@port.ac.uk","Elsevier B.V.",09255273,,IJPCE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007256762

Assisting CSR issues in one individual firm will thoroughly influence other supply chain members. In this paper, a supplier-retailer SC is considered in a newsvendor setting. It is possible for the supplier to invest in CSR activities which could improve the popularity of products and, subsequently, market demand. Firstly, both members' decisions under decentralized and centralized decision-making models are investigated; afterwards, a novel collaborative model is proposed to determine optimal order quantity and CSR investment, thus maximizing the whole SC profits and also motivating members to participate. Finally, the results of decentralized, centralized, and collaborative models are compared and some managerial insights are provided. Numerical experiments indicate that, under some circumstances, alongside the increment of SC profits, more CSR investment and better CSR performance level will be achieved through the collaborative model than other decision-making structures. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Collaborative decision-making; Corporate social responsibility; Order quantity; Supply chain coordination","Profitability; Supply chains; Centralized decision making; Collaborative decision making; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Decision-making structure; Order quantity; Social responsibilities; Supply chain coordination; Two-echelon supply chain; Decision making",,"Hosseini-Motlagh, S.-M.Iran; email: motlagh@iust.ac.ir","Elsevier B.V.",09255273,,IJPCE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002638741

We focus on a supply chain consisting of a home plant and a foreign branch, both of which are under the same parent company but have considerable autonomy. The role of the home plant is to provide a key component to the foreign branch with guaranteed service (required by the headquarters). Because of a high fixed order cost, the branch orders the component rather infrequently, causing high expediting costs at the home plant. Our purpose is to help the headquarters to improve the supply chain efficiency. We show that under certain conditions, the headquarters can coordinate the supply chain by setting an upper bound on the expediting frequency. If these conditions fail to hold, a simple fixed cost-sharing contract coordinates the supply chain. When centralized control is too costly or infeasible, the headquarters may delegate the contract design rights to the subunits. If the home plant receives the rights, the supply chain performance can be significantly improved (sometimes to near optimality). These results provide guidance to the headquarters on whether, when, and to whom to delegate the coordination initiatives. © 2016 Production and Operations Management Society","bilateral bargaining; cost-sharing contract; semi-centralized system; supply-chain coordination",,"NSFC: 70731003; CUHK",,"Wiley-Blackwell",10591478,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992316586

This work demonstrates the design and implementation of a remote real-time collaboration platform by using human motion capture technology powered by infrared light based depth imaging sensors and a synchronous data transfer protocol from computer networks. The unique functionality of the proposed platform is the sharing of physical contexts during a collaboration session by not only exchanging human actions but also the effects of those actions on the workpieces and the task environment. Results show that this platform could enable teams to remotely work on a common engineering problem at the same time and also get immediate feedback from each other making it valuable for collaborative design, inspection and verifications tasks in the factories of the future.

This paper studies an integrated CLSC network design problem with cost and environmental concerns in the solar energy industry from sustainability perspectives. A multi-objective closed-loop supply chain design (MCSCD) model has been proposed, in consideration of many practical characteristics including flow conservation at each production/recycling unit of forward/reverse logistics (FL/RL), capacity expansion, and recycled components. A deterministic multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model capturing the tradeoffs between the total cost and total CO2 emissions was developed to address the multistage CSLC design problem. Subsequently, a multi-objective PSO (MOPSO) algorithm with crowding distance-based nondominated sorting approach is developed to search the near-optimal solution of the MCSCD model. The computational study shows that the proposed MOPSO algorithm is suitable and effective for solving large-scale complicated CLSC structure than the conventional branch-and-bound optimization approach. Analysis results show that an enterprise needs to apply an adequate recycling strategy or energy saving technology to achieve a better economic effectiveness if the carbon emission regulation is applied. Consequently, the Pareto optimal solution obtained from MOPSO algorithm may give the superior suggestions of CLSC design, such as factory location options, capacity expansion, technology selection, purchasing, and order fulfillment decisions in practice. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Closed-loop supply chain design; Multi-objective searching; Particle swarm optimization; Solar energy industry","Algorithms; Carbon dioxide; Design; Economic and social effects; Energy conservation; Global warming; Integer programming; Optimal systems; Optimization; Pareto principle; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Recycling; Solar cells; Solar energy; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Branch-and-bound optimization; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); Energy-saving technologies; Forward/reverse logistics; Mixed integer linear programming model; Multi objective; Solar energy industries; Multiobjective optimization","MOST: 103-2221-E-039-008, NSC 101-2221-E-029-008-MY3","Wang, L.-C.; Department of Industrial Engineering and Enterprise information, Taiwan; email: wanglc@thu.edu.tw","Elsevier Ltd",07365845,,RCIME,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951152496

Consequently, nowadays, the protection of food products often ends at the gates of the producer without any investigation about the status of their quality at the consumer's location. The aim of this paper was the development of a supply chain monitoring system based on a smart logistic unit (SLU) to support the integrated management of the food supply chain from “farm to fork” in order to guarantee and control food safety and shelf life (SL) of products in agreement with logistic efficiency and system sustainability. For this purpose we have conducted a research involving the selection of a perishable product significantly affected by logistic decisions, the determination of the set parameters representative of its quality and the development of a prototype of SLU, based on a sensor network for monitoring the identified parameters. Finally, an experimental SL model has been determined, based on the volatile organic compounds emitted from fruits and monitored by the SLU. We have validated the model by simulating real transport conditions and assessing the residual SL of the product at different time intervals. Practical Applications: The practical application obtainable from our research is the development of a prototype of a smart logistic unit able to translate the acquired parameters into valuable information for supply chain management. In particular the proposed research establishes a correlation between volatile organic compounds and bacterial growth to obtain a mathematical model to predict the residual shelf life of the products and to assess the effects of vibration, caused by simulated transport. The knowledge of the residual shelf life in real time could finally be exploited for developing advanced supply chain strategies e.g., picking and transport routing policies. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Accident prevention; Consumer protection; Food preservation; Food products; Food safety; Food supply; Organic compounds; Research and development management; Sensor networks; Software prototyping; Volatile organic compounds; Efficient managements; Identified parameter; Information and communication systems; Integrated management; Monitoring system; Perishable product; Supply chain strategy; System sustainability; Supply chain management",,"La Scalia, G.; Dipartimento di Ingegneria Chimica, Scuola Politecnica, Viale delle Scienze Ed. 8, Italy; email: giada.lascalia@unipa.it","Blackwell Publishing Inc.",01458876,,JFPED,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949238596

Previous research on scheduling mostly focused on the ideal scheduling environment which was generally based on the certainty mathematics models, thus there was a large gap between theory and practice of production scheduling. To this end, we proposed the research on the optimal sequence scheduling method for coordination assembly of functional coordination compounds, which used the fuzzy number to express uncertain demand and capacity. The Coordination process model of abstract functional coordination compounds was studied-extended state task network (ESTN). Based on the extended state task network, the fuzzy MILP model and parameter programming model of the problem were established. The scatter search algorithm and the heuristic algorithm for the scheduling of the coordination assembly process scheduling of functional coordination compounds were studied. Simulation results show that the proposed method can solve the disadvantages of the traditional method, and has widespread value in use. © 2017 IEEE.","Coordination; Functional coordination compound; Optimal order; Scheduling method","Fuzzy sets; Heuristic algorithms; Integer programming; Optimization; Production control; Scheduling; Supply chain management; Time domain analysis; Coordination; Coordination assembly; Functional coordination; Optimal ordering; Performance indicators; Production Scheduling; Scatter search algorithm; Scheduling methods; Scheduling algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509048687,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014029615

On the other hand, Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) systems have reached an age of maturity that allows for their utilization towards tackling dynamic market conditions and aligning SC management focus with sustainability considerations. However, extant research only myopically tackles the sustainability potential of AGVs, focusing more on addressing network optimization problems and less on developing integrated and systematic methodological approaches for promoting economic, environmental and social sustainability. To that end, the present study provides a critical taxonomy of key decisions for facilitating the adoption of AGV systems into SC design and planning, as these are mapped on the relevant strategic, tactical and operational levels of the natural hierarchy. We then propose the Sustainable Supply Chain Cube (S2C2), a conceptual tool that integrates sustainable SC management with the proposed hierarchical decision-making framework for AGVs. Market opportunities and the potential of integrating AGVs into a SC context with the use of the S2C2 tool are further discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Automated Guided Vehicles; Decision-making framework; Literature taxonomy; Sustainable Supply Chain Cube (S2C2) tool; Sustainable supply chain management","Automatic guided vehicles; Automation; Climate change; Commerce; Decision making; Mobile robots; Optimization; Sustainable development; Taxonomies; Transportation; Vehicles; Automated guided vehicles; Decision-making frameworks; Environmental and social sustainability; Methodological approach; Network optimization problem; Sustainability considerations; Sustainability-potential; Sustainable supply chains; Supply chain management",,"Bechtsis, D.; Laboratory of Statistics and Quantitative Analysis Methods, P.O.

Conversely, the latter two emphasize the creation of economic and efficiency values, through the alignment of goals and resources directed by a stronger channel lead body. However, in the case of micro-producers, increasing these values is not the only motivation; lifestyle or esteem factors may be, for example, more potent drivers. The research extends multi-actor supply arrangements beyond chains and networks, by introducing the concept of supply communities. This is illustrated through a vignette of a regional food marketing umbrella group that plays an organizing role. Findings suggest intermediaries to act as triggers for collaboration.

In contrast, Content Delivery Network (CDN) is an overlay solution in current IP networks. We believe that even though ICN is fully deployed, there is still a role for CDNs to play in ICN networks. Since ISPs in ICN will replicate and forward contents according to their policies and interests, it may not align with the objectives of Content Providers (CPs). Therefore, CPs are willing pay a third party (i.e., CDN providers) a certain fee to meet their own requirements. In this paper, we propose to use the inventory model of Supply Chain Management (SCM) in logistics to formulate the content delivery process of ICN networks. The product-centric model of SCM is well-suited for the content-centric content delivery process of ICN networks. Also, we propose the system framework of inventory Centric Delivery Network (iCDN).

The following questions are central to our research: To what extent is the efficiency and effectiveness of the supply chain for these products enhanced as a result of the implementation of the new medical reform? Is the level of availability and affordability of these medicines enhanced among consumers in the rural areas as a result of the reform? What is the role of rural medical institutions, such as district hospitals and outpatient clinics, in ensuring a more efficient and adequate supply mechanism for these products in the rural areas? Has the implementation of the new reform led to a more efficient management of the relationship between the essential medicines supply chain and government rural Cooperative Medical System?

Based on system development and propagation of herbs information in Uttaradit Province it was found that information database system was able to support production activity of persons related in supply chain of herbs business in Uttaradit Province in the form of clusters for sharing raw materials divided into 2 clusters including: A. Cluster between herbs farmers and producers or processor, i.e., producers were able to select raw materials based on information of farmers for raw materials pricing and delivering; B. Cluster between farmers and Thai traditional medicine group. The results of this research showed that both clusters were assembled and consisted of 15 farmers, 3 herbal drugstore entrepreneurs, 20 physicians of Thai traditional medicine, 4 academics of hospitals, and 5 herbs processing factories. Whereas, Jintana Herbs factory that was one of those herbs processing factories was able to reduce its cost of raw materials by 12.91% in overall. In addition, farmers were able to increase their sales volume of herbs by 18.45% due to the assembly of cluster between farmers and processors. In overall, it could be seen that clusters established in Uttaradit Province started to develop their businesses as well as improve their abilities and potential on herbs market competition in Uttaradit Province increasingly. © 2017 ACM.","Cluster; Database; Information exchange; Knowledge network; Supply chain; Thai herbs","Agriculture; Competition; Education; Information dissemination; Knowledge management; Supply chains; Cluster; Information database; Information exchanges; Knowledge networks; Market competition; Production activity; System development; Thai herbs; Database systems","URU; NRCT","Thongsiri, S.; Uttaradit Rajabhat University, 27 Injaimee Road, Thailand; email: S.thongsiri@gmail.com","Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450348034,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015617441

Companies and government in many countries have started realizing the importance of greening their supply chains. Green supply chain management has gained special attention of public and many companies are now interested in adopting it as their strategy to advance their brand image, capturing more market share and to win the trust of the customer. The purpose of this paper is to explore the diverse performance indicators and sub-indicators responsible for green supply chain management implementation and to check its reliability and to rank them using analytic hierarchy process analysis. After extensive literature review and consulting Industrial experts, the study has suggested 13 performance indicators and 79 sub-indicators. The quantitative phase was conducted through a survey using standard questionnaire with various agro based companies followed by a qualitative phase, where the duly filled questionnaires were received, edited and further analyzed. It has been concluded that internal environmental management, environmental design and regulatory pressure are ranked as the top three performance indicators. The sensitivity analysis has also been performed to see the effect of weightage on the final ranking of performance indicators. This is one of the first studies that suggest the performance indicators for implementation of green supply chain management in agro industry.

We designed 4 relational database sets. First set consists of the list of traded commodities and their HS code. The second is about matching relation between traded products and their raw or intermediate materials. The third is composed of diverse usage databases of raw or intermediate materials compiled by using patent data, and the fourth is about the patent data of individual substances. Then, we implement visualizing the supply chain network from raw materials to traded products by linking 4 database sets.

Here we investigate whether the marine biosphere can be identified as a source of Se and of other trace elements in precipitation samples. We used artificial neural network (ANN) modeling and other statistical methods to analyze relationships between a high-resolution atmospheric deposition chemistry time series (March 2007-January 2009) from Plynlimon (UK) and exposure of air masses to marine chlorophyll a and to other source proxies. Using ANN sensitivity analyses, we found that higher air mass exposure to marine productivity leads to higher concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in rainfall. Furthermore, marine productivity was found to be an important but indirect factor in controlling Se as well as vanadium (V), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), and aluminum (Al) concentrations in atmospheric deposition, likely via scavenging by organic compounds derived from marine organisms. Marine organisms may thus play an indirect but important role in the delivery of trace elements to terrestrial environments and food chains. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Aluminum coatings; Carbon; Chemical analysis; Cobalt compounds; Deposition; Marine biology; Meteorological problems; Meteorology; Neural networks; Nickel; Organic carbon; Selenium; Sensitivity analysis; Trace elements; Vanadium compounds; Water analysis; Zinc; Artificial neural network models; Atmospheric depositions; Atmospheric process; Dissolved organic carbon; Marine productivity; Precipitation samples; Primary productivity; Terrestrial environments; Atmospheric chemistry; aluminum; chlorophyll a; cobalt; dissolved organic matter; nickel; organic carbon; rain; selenium; trace element; vanadium; zinc; carbon; air mass; artificial neural network; atmospheric deposition; biosphere; chlorophyll a; concentration (composition); dissolved organic carbon; food chain; marine environment; organic compound; precipitation (chemistry); rainfall; scavenging (chemistry); selenium; terrestrial environment; trace element; vanadium; wet deposition; aerosol; Article; artificial neural network; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric transport; biosphere; boundary layer; controlled study; food chain; marine species; perceptron; precipitation; time series analysis; urban area; environmental monitoring; Ceredigion; Plynlimon; United Kingdom; Wales; Carbon; Cobalt; Environmental Monitoring; Selenium; Trace Elements",,"Winkel, L.H.E.; Eawag, Switzerland; email: Lenny.Winkel@eawag.ch","American Chemical Society",0013936X,,ESTHA,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021853341

To this end, order management, order replenishment and inventory control activities of a two-echelon SC are examined via modeling using discrete event simulation. By determining the appropriate parameters for the incentives with scenario analysis, balanced profit distribution between buyers and a supplier in VMI is established. Simulation outputs of the traditional model, VMI only and VMI with incentives models are compared based on profits with paired comparisons. In VMI with incentives, both buyers, and the supplier experience higher benefits than the traditional system. This study provides a new method which eliminates the unbalanced benefit distribution due to VMI and offers almost equal benefits to the participating firms.

The fertility capacity of women diminishes in parallel with aging. The mechanisms for reproductive aging are not fully understood. We have observed a decline in Brca1 mediated DNA repair in aging rat primordial follicles. To further understand the age-related molecular changes, we performed microarray gene expression analysis using total RNA extracted from immature (18 to 20 day old) and aged (400 to 450 day old) rat primordial follicles. The results of current microarray study revealed that there were 1,011 (>1.5 fold, p<0.05) genes differentially expressed between two groups in which 422 genes were up-regulated and 589 genes were down-regulated in aged rat primordial follicles compared to immature primordial follicles. The gene ontology and pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed a critical biological function such as cell cycle, oocyte meiosis, chromosomal stability, transcriptional activity, DNA replication, and DNA repair were affected by age.

Due to ineffective domestic influencing strategies, the CSOs adopted the TAN approach and escalated to an international supply chain movement approach (ISCMA) aiming to influence international stakeholders at each stage of the sugar supply chain in order to leverage boomerang pressure on the sugar producing companies and the Government of Cambodia. Despite its resourceful networking strategies, the ISCMA failed to leverage significant influence on the sugar companies and the government to achieve its demands. The failure was not due to weak networks, but was in part due to the political nexus between the government and the sugar companies. This article suggests that to ensure the effectiveness of CSOs’ actions within the TAN framework in the global production networks, one should take into account the power of the government in relation to local politico-commercial elites. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","civil society organizations; global supply chains; production networks; Social movements; transnational advocacy networks",,,"Sokphea, Y.; School of Social and Political Sciences, 420 John Medley Building, Australia; email: sophiabelieve@gmail.com","Routledge",17448689,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85001975406

The firms compete in manufacture, storage and distribution of a product to several markets. Each firm aims at maximisation of its own profit by optimising the design capacity and product flow in the supply chain. We model the supply chain network as a multi-layer graph of manufacturing nodes, distribution nodes and storage centres. To optimise the network, we adopt the mechanisms of a foraging behaviour of slime mould Physarum polycephalym. First, we extend the original Physarum model to deal with networks with multiple sources and sinks. Second, we develop a novel method to solve the user equilibrium (UE) problem by exploiting the adaptivity of the Physarum model: we update the link costs according to the product flow. Third, we refer to an equivalent transformation between system optimum problem and UE problem to determine the optimal product flows and design capacities of a supply chain. At last, we present an approach to update the amount of product supplied by each firm.

The merchandise may perish or be perished during conveyance because of disadvantageous weather or collision in carrying such that the number of intact cargoes may be insufficient for the buyers. Hence, according to the perspective of supply chain management, the reliability, a probability of the network to successfully deliver the cargoes from the suppliers to the buyers subject to a budget, is proposed to be a performance index, where the suppliers and buyers are not the previous customers.

The beef supply chain is a complex supply chain, with global (EU and Non EU) sourcing strategies in order to secure supply. However, managing these complex supply chains can be difficult and consequentially can expose vulnerabilities similar to that of horsemeat, where horsemeat was found in beef meat within EU supply chains. Six months after the crisis broke, an independent review into the integrity and assurance of food supply networks was commissioned by the UK government and undertaken by Professor Chris Elliott of Queen’s University, Belfast. The review recommended eight pillars of food integrity to industry and government: consumers first, zero tolerance, intelligence gathering, laboratory services, audit, government support, leadership and crisis management. This article examines the extent to which these recommendations have been implemented using personal communications from Professor Chris Elliott and relevant industry bodies. Following the review, industry attitudes have changed substantially, testing and surveillance systems have been integrated into normal industry practice and the government is more prepared for future incidents through the establishment of the National Food Crime Unit (NFCU). Horsegate raised the profile of food fraud and crime in supply chains and despite improvements to date, further collaboration between industry and government is required in order to align fully with the recommendations. © The Author(s) 2017.",,,"DAERA: ES/M003094/1, PG14/05; ESRC","Dean, M.; Institute for Global Food Security, United Kingdom; email: moira.dean@qub.ac.uk","Nature Research",23968370,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136443733

This issue magnifies the necessity for increased scrutiny towards issues such as environmental considerations and product recovery in closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs). The most important motivational factors influencing research on these topics can be considered in two general groups: environment-friendly legal requirements and cost efficiencies. The most important elements in the closed-loop supply chain include collection centers and treatment centers. This paper intended to design a network according to the mentioned principles. In this regard, three types of product treatment centers were taken into account: physical, biological, and thermal. The network design was made via a new mixed multi-objective nonlinear mathematical model of integers. In this model, three objective functions were considered that included profit maximization, pollution minimization, and the minimization of the number of facilities under construction. The model was obtained after determining the number of collection and treatment centers, the number of containers for storage of different waste materials, the amount of waste sent from collection centers to the treatment centers, and the areas covered by collection centers. Due to the conflicting objective functions, a corrected NSGAII algorithm was used to solve this model. The change applied in the mentioned algorithm was made to determine the appropriate amount of the crossover percentage. The improvement in the performance of the proposed solution algorithm is shown using a numerical example. To prove the improved performance, a T-test was used to compare the means between the two populations. To select the optimum answer from the Pareto solution set, indices of D, S, and solution time were used and solved with TOPSIS. © 2017, Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology.

He suggested that different processes in production of goods can be coordinated in large-sized networks. One of the most important tools becomes the Internet of things (IoT). The implementation of IoT takes place not only in the production but also in the procedures which are used in the supply chains on the global market. Transport and logistics operators have started the development and implementation of IoT within their companies as well as outside of them. An important part of new solutions involves the data exchange between the transport vehicles and objects in their environment—particularly in public transport infrastructure which this paper addresses. Firstly, an overview is provided on multiple reports published by research institutes and market players. Secondly, this paper presents solutions that were implemented before 2016. The analysis provides a description of the challenge in modern transport systems and a discussion of possible actions for transport and logistics operators who aim to keep or improve their market position. Additionally, another part of the paper analyzes the impact on the market of transport and value-added services by the implementation of autonomous vehicles and the new generation of robots by transport and logistics operators. The main conclusion is the recommendation to promote closer cooperation between research institutes and market players as well as public authorities.

While research on business-to-business relationship has identified a few relationship-destroying factors, such as supplier opportunism (Brown et al. 2000), channel conflict (Hibbard et al. 2001), and supplier unfairness (Kumar et al. 1995), a phenomenon of perceived channel exclusion that emerged from recent industry reports appears to be potentially detrimental to the well-being of channel relationships. This research aims to shed some initial lights on this phenomenon.

Yet concurrently, social, environmental, and ethical problems have arisen and continue to persist, despite government, private sector, and nongovernmental efforts to address them. What are effective methods for global firms, or buyers, to gain an understanding of problems in the supply chain and to address them? We examine strategies using a sense and response framework, and find various approaches within this framework to be associated with improved performance. In particular, research suggests that using a collaborative, proactive approach with suppliers and providing meaningful incentives can be effective. There exists an opportunity to cascade these efforts to second tier suppliers and beyond, where some of the greatest impacts and opportunities to affect change lie. In this chapter, we discuss supply chain practices associated with improved social, environmental, and in several cases, economic performance. We discuss how leading firms are building upon compliance programs, which remain important, to increase their emphasis on building shared value for various actors along the supply chain. © 2017, Yann Bouchery, Charles J.

So-called distributed manufacturing systems represent an ideal approach to meet challenges regarding individualisation of products, customer proximity or more sustainable production. Networks of smart and agile micro-production units lead to a rationalisation of the supply chain and therefore to an increase of sustainability. In this paper, the actual state of the art in distributed manufacturing is presented. Afterwards, sustainability oriented reasons for a trend towards distributed manufacturing networks are explained. Then, evolutionary stages in the development of factories are represented describing their characteristics at every stage. Finally, a framework of possible network models for distributed manufacturing networks of smart and agile mini-factories is provided and enforced by examples from industrial practice.

In many cases, supply and demand are different in principal. These major differences force producers to make various decisions for supplying required raw materials and meeting demands. Respecting the low operational and high strategic costs of applying the rail transport, it is highly recommended to use this method of transportation for the purpose of transporting huge load of materials/products in a centralised network. However, using vehicles and road transport is more suitable for small loads of materials/products in widespread networks. Current study is devoted to design an efficient hybrid transportation system and an agile multi-product supply chain. A mathematical model is presented in order to formulate the problem at hand. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of the presented model and the applied optimisation procedure in making optimum and applicable decisions. In fact, numerical results reveal the promising ability of the applied optimisation procedure confronting real-world situations.

The network consists of raw material suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and demand market. The supply chains compete in a non-cooperative manner and manufacturers produce homogeneous products. The objective is to maximise the future profits of both chains. First, the problem is formulated by mathematical programming and Lagrangian theory is used for adding the constraints to the objective function. Then, the equilibrium conditions are derived and the problem is formulated as a finite-dimensional variational inequality model. Qualitative properties of the equilibrium pattern are derived to establish existence and uniqueness results under reasonable conditions. The modified projection method is used to solve the variational inequality problem. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed model and analyse the results under different conditions.

Originality/gap/relevance/implications: The investigation revealed a lack of relationship among the organizations' profile, its environmental, economic and operational performance and GSCM practices. Key methodological aspects: The relationship among constructs was established through bibliometric analysis obtained in the models/frameworks of GSCM practices and performance extracted from the databases “ProQuest”, “EBSCO”, “JSTOR”, “Web of Science” and “Scopus”. Further, the content analysis and network analysis were then performed. Summary of key results: GSCM internal and external practices, environmental performance, economic performance and operational performance were revealed as main topics addressed in GSCM. Moreover, it was noted that studies on internal practices prevailed over those addressed to other practices. Key considerations/conclusions: The models studied did not consider whether the corporate green profile could improve the performance of the organization. Therefore, they did not simultaneously measure environmental, economic and operational performance. It was concluded that the addition of the green profile in conjunction with GSCM practices and performance allows for a more in-depth analysis of the degree of a company's involvement with GSCM, as well as its intended objectives and results achieved in the future. © 2017 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

In this context, oil supply chains should be studied in order to improve their efficiency, while remaining flexible to successfully handle certain types of contingencies, such as lack of products or fleet unavailability. At the distribution level, tankers are commonly used in the downstream activities to transport the derivative products from distribution centres to service stations, comprising the secondary distribution level. This operation is usually short-term scaled to meet final consumers’ demand. However, the availability and proper sizing of a fleet to perform the required distribution can be a complex problem due to the fact that demand is known on short notice and the distribution network may include hundreds of demand points to be satisfied. In this chapter, the T2S.opt—Tank to Station Optimizer—decision support tool is presented. T2S.opt addresses the fleet distribution planning problem under normal and abnormal operational scenarios. The optimal planning covers short-term solutions and minimizes operational costs. A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) was developed and implemented to be used through a proper user interface, giving origin to T2S.opt.

Thus, how to survive in this highly fluctuating economic atmosphere is an attractive topic for corporate managers, especially when an economy goes into a severe recession. One of the most consensus conclusions is to highly integrate a corporate’s supply chain network, as it can facilitate knowledge circulation, reduce transportation cost, increase market share, and sustain customer loyalty. However, a corporate’s supply chain relations are unapparent and opaque. To solve such an obstacle, this study integrates text mining (TM) and social network analysis (SNA) techniques to exploit the latent relation among corporates from social media news. Sequentially, this study examines its impact on corporate operating performance forecasting. The empirical result shows that the proposed mechanism is a promising alternative for performance forecasting. Public authorities and decision makers can thus consider the potential implications when forming a future policy. © PACIS 2017.","Decision making; Forecasting; Social network analysis; Text mining","Commerce; Competition; Decision making; Information systems; Information use; Social networking (online); Supply chains; Knowledge circulation; Market globalization; Operating performance; Performance forecasting; Public authorities; Supply chain network; Text mining techniques; Transportation cost; Text mining","MICYT: 105-2410-H-110 -033 -MY2","Hsu, M.-F.; English Program of Global Business, 55, Hwa-Kang Rd., Yang-Ming-Shan, Taiwan; email: hsumf0222@gmail.com","Association for Information Systems",,,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091118177

This approach relies on physics-based analysis to evaluate the correlations between the airframe design, as well as propulsion, aircraft systems, aerodynamics, structures and emission, from the early design process, and to exploit the synergies within a simultaneous optimization process. Further, the disciplinary analysis modules from multiple organizations, involved in the optimization are integrated within a distributed framework. The disciplinary analysis tools are not shared, but only the data are distributed among partners through a secured network of framework. In order to enable and to accelerate the deployment of collaborative, large scale design and optimization frameworks, the “AGILE Paradigm”, a novel methodology, has been formulated during the project. The main elements composing the AGILE Paradigm are the Knowledge Architecture (KA), and the Collaborative Architecture (CA). The first formalizes the overall product development process in a multi-level structure. The latter formalizes the collaborative process within the entire supply chain, and defines how the multiple stakeholders interact with each other.The current paper is focused on the application of using the AGILE Paradigm to solve system of stystems MDO on a regional jet transport aircraft. The focus of the current research paper is: 1) Creation of a system of systems frame work using AGILE Paradigm to support multi-disciplinary distributive analysis capability. The framework involves physics based modules such as : Airframe synthesis, aerodynamics, structures, aircraft systems , propulsion system design, nacelle design, nacelle airframe integration, aircraft mission simulation,costs and emissions. 2) Validate the frame work with case study of a regional jet reference aircraft. 3) Assess the sensitivity and coupling of design parameters, local disciplinary optimizataion and its effect on global optimization objectives or constraints. The effects of varying Bypass Ratio (BPR) of engine, offtake effects due to degree of electrification and nacelle effects are propagated through the AGILE MDO framework and presented. © 2017 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The network connects 3 coal export terminals to 31 load points and haulage distances can extend up to 364 km. The scheduling problem consists of finding a high-quality schedule for trains travelling from a terminal to a load point and back, respecting all constraints imposed by the network itself and the operational environment. Those constraints refer to a mix of single and double tracks, limited parking facilities along the tracks, loading capacity at the load points, as well as minimum spacing (headway) between trains. The decision variables include the travel speeds at each section of the network and the amount of dwell time for each train at each parking facility along the route. To test our approach, a simplified model of the HVCCC network, with 3 terminals, 11 load points and 40 sections was used. The objective function is the minimization of the total travel times. A lower bound for that objective function was calculated with the trains travelling at maximum speed, and no constraints being applied. Three scenarios were tested, with 15, 30 and 60 trains; and with different configurations of the genetic algorithm. The results are presented in the form of a table with a number of statistics related to the solutions found, namely average travel time (with standard deviation), plus shortest and longest travel times, and CPU times. Relative to the lower bounds, the gaps for the average trip time range between 14% and 50%, depending of the problem size. These initial results are encouraging, considering the complexity of the system, the number and complexity of constraints, and the CPU time required by the method. Finally, in the discussion section we indicate possible paths of future research. © 2017 Proceedings - 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2017.

These movements are characterised by long supply chains; distances between production, processing and markets are often thousands of kilometres, and rarely less than hundreds. To compete, farmers and producers require efficient transport options, which in turn, relies on uninterrupted transport infrastructure and an optimal mix of rail and heavy vehicles enabled by considered policy. To provide a holistic view of transport logistics costs and benefits due to infrastructure investments and policy changes in agriculture supply chains in Australia, CSIRO developed the Transport Network Strategic Investment Tool (TraNSIT). TraNSIT was identified as the preferred tool to help in unlocking a more efficient agricultural transport system to meet the Australian Government’s key objective of the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper of building the infrastructure of the 21st century. Under this programme of work, TraNSIT was able to provide governments, industry, the farming community and other stakeholders with a baseline of freight transport costs between Australian agricultural value chain enterprises, along with a capacity to identify and evaluate a range of scenarios to minimise transport costs and maximise long-term profitability. The extension of TraNSIT to broader Australian agricultural commodities was conducted with support, input and validation from over 80 organisations, agencies and associations representing the agricultural/horticultural and transport sectors. Aside from the insights used to ensure the model reflected industry logistic systems and processes, these contributors provided data for 222,000 enterprises across the commodities supply chains including farms, processors, storage facilities, saleyards, abattoirs, export depots, supermarkets and distribution centres which were incorporated into TraNSIT. The enterprises represented supply chain distribution points for the commodities modelled which were livestock, diary, grains, cotton, rice, sugar, stockfeed and horticulture. From this data a set of synthetic trips were created so that annual/monthly total tonnage (or head) transported across the road/rail network were representative of past movements. In total there were 332,000 different origin to destination paths created. This paper highlights the application of TraNSIT to 98% of Australia’s Agricultural production and the importance of the industry and government support to identify synergistic efficiency gains in transport. It represents the largest logistics data set assembled and transport modelling ever conducted for Australian agriculture. © 2017 Proceedings - 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2017.

With 25,000 inhabitants in 2011, it had remained a non-growth locality for half a century, a place that had fallen off the map of Indian liberal development. Nevertheless, behind a landscape of decay and ruin, dotted with 200 Sufi tombs, a lively network of circulation emerges beside a rich diaspora connected to an expanding Muslim community. It reveals complex ramifications of transnational trade, subaltern cosmopolitanism and intensive job circulation in South-East Asia and the Gulf monarchies, fuel flows and accumulations of wealth. An unbound town appears, with linkages throughout the Indian Ocean. Parangipettai is a relevant case for SUBURBIN as it questions, as many Indian localities could, the dominant metro-centric narratives and the prevalent conception of development as necessarily driven by urban concentration and a mechanical redistribution of wealth. Indian Ocean connections have been of great importance for over two centuries. Hence, the hierarchical model usually associated with the spatial and size distribution of cities does not apply here. Parangipettai is not a place of redistribution of banal activities, dependent on a chain of larger cities. Nevertheless, the business friendly developmentalist perspective can be seen in the implementation of a mega-power plant that will serve distant industrial needs and support the large cities’ access to a continuous electricity supply. © Springer India 2017.","Indian ocean trade; Marakayar; Parangipettai; Subaltern transnationalism; Tamil muslim",,,"Denis, E.; Géographie-cités, France; email: eric.denis@parisgeo.cnrs.fr","Springer",23670045,,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075872901

The strengths and shortcomings of those data sources have been evaluated in the literature; the sources can be useful for modeling, but they do not necessarily support a supply chain approach or provide the level of detail or accuracy desired for modeling a particular commodity’s supply chain and flow on a city or state roadway network. This paper expands on the work of NCFRP Report 35: Implementing the Freight Transportation Data Architecture: Data Element Dictionary by finding existing data sources unique to specific commodities that identify key supply chain locations and industry relationships and that provide more detail about commodity quantity and movement to overcome the limitations of traditional freight data sources. The goal of the investigation was to find more data sets to use in commodity flow modeling. For each commodity, this paper describes data sources found, data attributes, and how those data were used to estimate flow from origins and destinations within supply chain links.

Consolidation is used to solve producers' and transporters' needs to reduce cost, maximize service level between origin and destination and improve flexibility of multimodal transport. It is caused because of a) Equipment's Consolidation (EC) capacity, b) use of Chassis Truck (CT) for several transport methods, merchandise type and Cargo Unit's (CU) nature. The first objective of this article is to show the nomenclature for different kind of alternatives for transport consolidation, which is proposed based on a previous literature review, where were found Inventory Consolidation Models, Collaboration Strategies, Models for Terminal Optimization, among others; but no inventory and interaction of all possible alternatives of CU, EC, CT in multimodal features which allow a clear and easy identification in decision making.

Although the success factors play an absolutely necessary role in improving logistics-related activities and operations, there is a knowledge gap in the literature regarding their role as an instrument that can boost economic growth. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to identify and subsequently compare the success factors in the logistics clusters in three key specific regions: East Asia-Pacific, North America, and Western Europe. This paper employed a systematic literature review methodology, which identified 50 publications. The research characteristics and objectives were evaluated using a bibliometric analysis identifying a high concentration of articles and publications focusing on describing the technology, and innovation in the regions of East Asia-Pacific and Western Europe as principal and more important elements of the literature review. The findings obtained suggest that the identified success factors that increase the regional growth are equivalent in function among the three regions.

The implementation of IoT (Internet of Things) in logistic services is needed for increasing competitiveness leading to the establishment of so-called smart logistic transport. We propose the implementation model of the Indonesian Smart Logistic Transport, by focusing on cold supply chain system. We have conducted an engineering economic analysis of the smart logistics transport, in relation with the mobile network platform of 2G, 3G, 4G. Development of the implementation model is completed by conducting in-depth interviews with the application customers, technological vendors, regulator and network provider. Based on implementation trial in September-October 2015 and engineering economic analysis, we have found that Smart Logistic Transport is not feasible only on scenario 3 for CD6 at 4G network. Such condition is caused by the expensive price of 4Gs M2M gateway module and MDVR. Therefore, it requires the minimum amount of implemented truck to make implementation feasible. Our proposed model has signified 11 features, i.e. 2 basic feature and 9 advanced features, formulating the Indonesian smart logistics transport system. Due to the dynamic business process, customers may need specific advanced features in the future. By taking such opportunity, Indonesian local content developer can work to develop any relevant application features, which is needed by the logistic companies in the near future. © 2017 IEEE.","4G network; Engineering economic; Internet of Things (IoT); Logistic services; Supply chain",,,"Muhammad; Industrial Engineering (IE) Department, Indonesia; email: muhammad42@ui.ac.id","IEOM Society",21698767,,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067076708

Research on production networks has been limited in that studies focus on a single or a small set of production phases or production methods or that only linear cause-effect-relationship are being studied. Consequently, feedback and feedforward loops are insufficiently captured in these partial studies. This paper closes the gap by conceptualizing production networks that include the entire product lifecycle including the resulting complex structures and interdependencies. The paper introduces a framework with standardized modules (modelled as input-output systems) that can be combined into alternative product-independent production networks. Depending on the requirements modules of different granularity are presented. The paper then applies the framework to the case of car manufacturing and recycling. The merits of this innovative research are twofold. Such a material and energy flow framework was previously not available, thus the research promises original results. Furthermore, the results can serve as excellent input for companies in their planning and assessment of environmentally oriented production networks. © 2017 IEEE.","Input-output modules; Production Networks; Sustainability; Traceability",,,"Baumann, S.; College of Management, Paffrath-Str. 101, Germany; email: sabine.baumann@jade-hs.de","IEOM Society",21698767,,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066998820

The key design decisions are the number, capacity and location of plants and DCs, the ow of products through the network, and the selection of TMs for each ow path. A bi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is first formulated. The two incompatible objectives are minimizing the total cost and maximizing the demand fill rate. The model is validated by applying to the case of the design of fresh apple supply chain. Then, a new metaheuristic, called multi-objective modified particle swarm optimization (MMPSO), is presented to find non-dominated solutions. A new modified binary PSO for updating binary variables along with the adaptive mutation is incorporated into the MMPSO. The MMPSO is compared with a multi-objective basic PSO (MBPSO) and the NSGA-II against three small cases and six randomly generated medium and large size problems.

The network consists of manufacturers, retailers and consumer markets engaging in a Cournot-Nash game. Retailers are responsible for collecting WEEE in the network. It is assumed that the price of the reman- ufactured goods is different from that of the newly manufactured ones. The network equilibrium occurs when all players agree on volumes and prices. Sev- eral properties of the model are examined and the modified projection method is utilized to obtain the optimal solutions. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the impact of CLSC parameters on the profits of channel members and consumer benefits, and to provide policy support for governments. We find that it is necessary to regulate a medium collection rate and a certain minimum recovery rate. This is also advantageous to manufacturers in producing new manufactured products. The impact of collection rate and recovery rate on manufacturers are greater than that on retailers.

While network inventory control problems can be formulated as Markov decision processes, the resulting models can usually not be solved numerically due to the high dimension of the state space for instances of realistic size. In this paper the application of a recently developed approximation technique based on piece-wise linear convex approximations of the underlying value function is discussed for two well-known examples from supply chain optimization: multiple sourcing and dynamic inventory allocations. The examples show that the new technique can lead to policies with lower costs than the best currently known heuristics and at the same time yields further insights into the problem such as lower bounds for the achievable cost and an estimation of the value function. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Approximate dynamic programming; Markov decision processes; Supply chain optimization; Value iteration",,,"Laumanns, M.; IBM Research, Saeumerstrasse 4, Switzerland; email: mlm@zurich.ibm.com","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.",21948917,,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062088524

Natural catastrophes, technological failures or intentional attacks could cause energy supply disruptions. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of accident risks for entire energy chains is necessary. The complex network approach is a promising methodology to model certain stages of energy chains, such as, for example, natural gas transmission networks. This case study aims to analyze the European natural gas network and the potential consequences of seismic events and technical failures on the network’s flow capacities. The results show that the complex network methodology is applicable to geo-information data and very powerful to compute flows in energy networks. The highest risk for the network are high capacity pipelines bringing natural gas from either the South (North Africa), the East (Russia, Iran) or from the natural gas fields in the North (North Sea/Norwegian Sea) to Western Europe. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Gas hazards; Gas industry; Gases; Natural gas; Offshore gas fields; Reliability theory; Risk assessment; Comprehensive assessment; Intentional Attacks; Natural gas networks; Natural gas transmission; Network methodologies; Potential impacts; Technical failures; Technological failures; Complex networks","NRF: FI 370074011",,"CRC Press/Balkema",,9781138629370,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061346829

Access to customer demand needs to be shared effectively, and product and service deliveries must be tracked to provide visibility in the supply chain. Business process integration is based on standards and reference architectures, which should offer end-to-end integration of product data. Companies operating in supply chains establish process and data integration through the specialized intermediate companies, whose role is to establish interoperability by mapping and integrating company-specific data for various organizations and systems. This has typically caused high integration costs, and diffusion is slow. This paper investigates the requirements and functionalities of supply chain integration.

Taking supply chain network as a complex network, this paper analyses the evolutionary game of information sharing, and explores how network topology, probability of chromosome mutation and degree of punishment affect the evolutionary results of the network. Through the numerical simulation, it is found that a plateau exists in the information sharing process of a random network but does not exist in that of the regular network, indicating that the random network is more favourable to information sharing between enterprises of the supply chain; the probability of chromosome mutation is positively correlated with the frequency increase of information sharing but negatively with frequency stability; the degree of punishment contributes to the information sharing between the said enterprises. In long-term coopetition, the enterprises may play multiple games of information sharing and interest coordination, and tend to adjust their current game strategies based on the outcome of the previous game. In other words, the nodes in the supply chain network usually have memories. Considering this, the author introduced the genetic algorithm with memory to analyse the evolutionary game of information sharing in supply chain network. The resulting model boasts profound practical significance to the solution of information sharing and interests coordination among enterprises in supply chain network. © 2017 Lavoisier","Evolutionary game; Information sharing; Memory genetic algorithm; Supply chain network","Chromosomes; Complex networks; Genetic algorithms; Information analysis; Supply chains; Topology; Evolutionary games; Game strategies; Information sharing; Network topology; Paper analysis; Regular networks; Supply chain network; Topological structure; Information dissemination","ITA: 2016SWBZD06","Wang, Z.; Institute of Risk Management, China; email: 201301187@mail.gufe.edu.cn","Lavoisier",12696935,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060580958

This research addresses a gap in literature by using Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to uncover the public-private RFID network. It was found that the public-private sector relationship is initially characterised by stereotypical views which diminish as sectors work together. Further, the public sector in this context was seen to be a multiplicity with four different performances, public sector as a member of the public-private partnership; as legislator; as enforcer and as funding provider. This multiplicity is shown to lead to confusion within public-private partnerships as members of the partnership are not always clear about which performance of the public sector they are enacting, or interacting with.

In this paper, the chaos control problem is considered for a SCN with a time-varying delay between its entities. The innovation of this paper is the more comprehensive modeling, analysis, and control of chaotic behavior in the system. The proposed model has a control center to determine the orders of entities and control their inventories. Customer demand is modeled as an unknown exogenous disturbance. A robust H∞ control method is designed to control its chaotic behavior in terms of a certain linear matrix inequality technique that can be readily solved using the MATLAB LMI toolbox. By using this technique and calculating the maximum Lyapunov exponent, decision parameters are determined in such a way that the behavior of the SCN is stable. © TÜBITAK.","Chaotic behavior; Linear matrix inequality; Lyapunov exponent; Robust H∞ control; Supply chain network; Unknown demand","Complex networks; Decision making; Differential equations; Linear matrix inequalities; Lyapunov functions; Lyapunov methods; Supply chains; Chaotic behaviors; Lyapunov exponent; Robust H; Supply chain network; Unknown demand; Time varying control systems",,"Norouzi Nav, H.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Iran; email: noroozi_aukh@yahoo.com","Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Medical Sciences",13000632,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053839533

Supply chain management (SCM) consists of two basic processes: (a) production planning and inventory control process and (b) distribution and logistics process. The SCM objective is to maximize competitiveness and profitability not only for the company but the entire supply chain network, including the ultimate-customer. This is achieved by synchronizing customer requirements with the flow of materials from suppliers, while causing a reduction in inventory investment in the chain, and increasing the customer satisfaction. The selection of appropriate performance evaluation measures for supply chain analysis, given the inherent complexity in SCM, is critical. Traditional SCM performance measures focused on financial measures (e.g. net present value). Such methods are best suited for simple SCM applications. In addition, modeling transportation operations in SCM lacks a concise representation of the transportation cost function. The purpose of this paper is to review current status of SCM and propose a framework that integrates relevant performance measures and decision variables in SCM. The supply chain evaluation system includes resource, output, and flexibility measures. The framework includes a transportation optimization module and a supply chain module for routing decision using private or outsourced fleet. The optimization module incorporates not only transportation cost, but also other relevant performance measures. In addition, the framework includes a decision support system that integrates various measures and the trade-off among them. Finally, risk assessment is implemented to minimize supply chain disruptions and uncertainties. The proposed framework should be a valuable assessment tool for the newer generation of SCM applications. © 2017Canadian Society for Civil Engineering.

Near-real-time analysis of infrastructure dependency information is a computationally intensive process that has generally been observed informally by public safety officials. While system-level information may be desired, it has been beyond the capabilities of most local public safety and emergency management agencies. To address this problem, a Grassroots Infrastructure Dependency Model (GRID-M) was developed to enable near-real-time analysis of physical infrastructure dependencies of specific supply and demand nodes within four lifeline sectors: electricity, natural gas, water, and wastewater. The operational status of each node can be characterized as operational, partially operational, or not operational. These statuses are obtained by matching real-time outage or disruption data from utility providers with predetermined specific coping strategies based on a preincident limited infrastructure survey for specific assets within a network. This information can also be paired with a limited damage assessment to provide awareness of the accessibility to, and physical state of, each node within supply chains of interest. GRID-M displays all outputs within a Geographic Information Systems environment with additional prepopulated layers such as real-time traffic and demographic information of the affected communities. As such, GRID-M may be used following a major disaster to support the identification of priority response and recovery objectives based on the disruptions of critical local supply chains and their relationship with affected communities. © 2017 WIT Press","Critical infrastructure; Dependency; Disaster; Emergency management; Preparedness; Resilience; Supply chain","Civil defense; Critical infrastructures; Damage detection; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Emergency services; Real time systems; Risk management; Supply chains; Demographic information; Dependency; Dependency informations; Emergency management; Infrastructure assets; Infrastructure surveys; Preparedness; Resilience; Information management; coping strategy; demography; disaster management; GIS; safety; supply chain management",,,"WITPress",20419031,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053485307

Especially, reducing network complexity and finding alternative ASCs has recently been at the center of managers’ attentions, as ASC systems are becoming increasingly complex. This chapter provides a framework to model alternative ASC structures, which are subsequently analyzed using selected structural complexity indicators.

RFID systems consist of radio frequency (RF) tags and RF readers or interrogators. These systems are used for a wide range of applications that track, monitor, report, and manage items as they move between different physical locations. The tags consist of integrated circuits and an RF antenna. A wide range of extensions such as memory, sensors, encryption, and access control can be added to the tag. The interrogators query the tags for information stored on them, which can include items like identification numbers, user written data, or sensory data. The major areas that drive the commercial deployment of RFID technology are logistics, supply chain management, library item tracking, medical implants, road tolling (e.g., E-Z Pass), building access control, aviation security, and homeland security applications. Each of these RFID systems has customized requirements that currently are defined ad hoc. In addition, multiple, often competing, standards exist (ISO=IEC JTC1, ANSI, EPC, etc.) for RFID hardware, software, and data management. Thus, most of the RFID systems are deployed for closed loop applications using either proprietary protocols or nonintersecting standards with nonreusable tags and readers. As a result, in most applications, RFID tag and reader hardware and software must be specifically designed for each particular application, and must be physically modified or redesigned every time the specification for the current application is adjusted, as new applications are introduced, and the standards are modified or new standards are developed. This keeps the overall design time long and the system costs high. Figure 3.1 presents a comparison of different RFID tag design methodologies. The current state of the art tag development shown in Figure 3.1a requires lengthy design, fabrication, and testing cycles, which can take months with intellectual property (IP) reuse to years if developing new IP. A customizable RFID tag, as shown in Figure 3.1b, can handle variations in standards and requirements as they are developed with a significantly shorter time to market than current fiows. Such a tag could be mass produced and tailored to a particular RFID use after fabrication. With the use of automation to program the device, the design time could be reduced to hours or days. This chapter presents an extensible RFID tag system, as shown in Figure 3.2. The tag can be easily customized to work with different existing or newly developed standards and even concurrently with proprietary commands tailored to the desired application. The tag Applications, Technology, Security, and consists of automatically generated controller and physical layer hardware that works with existing air interface blocks. To generate the controller and physical layer blocks, a design automation methodology has been developed. For the physical layer, the methodology allows the specification of waveform features of the encoding, which are specified in a textual format. These features are then used as inputs to parameterized hardware blocks and combined with automatically generated customized hardware blocks. The result is automatically generated encoding and decoding hardware blocks. For the controller, the methodology allows RFID primitives or the commands employed by the RFID system to be specified using RFID macros, an assembly-like format. These RFID macros are processed to generate a template file to specify the behavior for each primitive or macro. All behavior is specified using ANSI-C allowing the user to create arbitrarily complex behaviors. Finally, the RFID compiler generates the final controller used for managing the tag. This technique allows the seamless coexistence of several RFID standards such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard 256-2001 [1] and the International Standards Organization (ISO) standard 18000 Part 7 [2]. The chapter is organized as follows: Section 3.2 contains some background on research and related work pertaining to RFID. The physical layer design automation fiow is presented in Section 3.3 with examples of encodings used in active, passive, and near-field communication standards. Section 3.4 describes the controller design automation fiow with examples demonstrated for various RFID standards such as ISO 18000 Part 7 and Part 6C.

It aims to assign a globally unique number to nearly every object equipped with a radio frequency identification chip (RFID tag). This EPC is serving as an identifier for the physical object carrying the tag, which can now be recognized, identified, and tracked by an IT infrastructure [1]. Though the EPC standard is actually a meta framework for different encoding schemes and name spaces, most EPCs have a structure similar to the one shown in Figure 29.1, which depicts an example EPC for one of the most popular standards, the Serialized Global Trade Identification Number (SGTIN) [1]. The consortium EPCglobal, originating from the Auto-ID labs of MIT as well as the former EAN International and Uniform Code Council (both now GS1), places its focus on the development and establishing of global standards for RFID, EPC, and the EPCglobal network. According to their intention, information about an object should in general not be stored on its RFID tag itself, but instead be supplied by distributed servers on the Internet [2]. By using the EPC and the help of an Object Naming Service (ONS) (also called Object Name Service in some documents), it will be possible to locate EPC Discovery and EPC Information Services (EPCIS), which are remotely accessible data collections about the particular object [3]. One of the advantages the EPCglobal network offers is to let many parties (e.g., manufacturers, suppliers, shops, or after-sale service providers) dynamically register any kind of EPCIS for the objects they are concerned with, thereby creating an open way to exchange product-related information. The designers of the EPCglobal network anticipate that a static list of available services would in general be outdated soon. As a solution, they propose to first ask the ONS (and not yet specified EPC Discovery Services) for a recent list of sources each time fresh information about a particular object is needed. After retrieving this list, one can directly contact all or some of the EPCIS that carry the information itself [4]. This procedure will in most cases not be conducted manually, but in an automated fashion, e.g., by the use of web services [5]. Example application scenarios include supply chain management [5]-increasing efficiency, flexibility, and cooperation-and potentially smart homes [6], where a home IT infrastructure needs to identify objects of the real world to provide services. Since ONS is a critical component of the EPCglobal network, we focus on its security issues.

The latter point represents one of the most promising benefits from RFID applications and is the focus of this chapter. Over the last four years, RFID technology has received a great deal of attention which was initially triggered by mandatory requirements from major organizations in the U.S. (e.g., Wal-Mart and U.S. Department of Defense) and in Europe (e.g., Metro AG and Tesco). Since then, the motivations for RFID adoption have moved from mandatory compliance to voluntary undertakings as companies are increasingly exploring the true potential of the technology, especially in the context of supply chains. As stated by Pisello (2006, p. 1), “the network effects of a synchronized supply chain will result in numerous benefits, including improved scan reliability, process automation, and real-time information access.” Recent key developments in technology with respect to hardware (i.e., integrated circuits, readers, antennas, printers) and software (i.e., firmware, middleware) have permitted to overcome some technical limitations of RFID applications. However, if the ability for automatic capture of data has improved substantially, the capacity to efficiently manage this data, and transform it into business intelligence is still limited. As the marketing director of an RFID solution provider involved in our project mentioned “Today, second generation tags are revolutionizing the way data is captured. Companies that initially performed pilots a couple years ago were faced with multiple technological limitations such as limited reading performance. Today, the main focus should be on one core component of RFID systems, that is the middleware.” While most supply chain managers have now some knowledge of what RFID technology is about, they do not yet grasp the full implications of the business process redesign entailed by RFID implementation, and their understanding of the required configuration in the middleware to optimize supply chain operations is still limited. The main objective of this chapter is to propose an approach for configuring and validating business rules in an RFID middleware. The proposed approach, relying on empirical evidence gathered from a detailed field study, will facilitate the dialog and bridge the gap between technical professionals and managers involved in RFID projects. This would in turn allow to better capitalize on the potential of RFID technology, which eventually lead to more successful RFID implementation. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Application programs; Automation; Firmware; Managers; Middleware; Software reliability; Supply chains; Automatic identification and data capture; Business process redesign; Radio frequency identification technology; Supply chain operation; Synchronized supply chains; Technical professionals; Technological limitations; U.s. department of defense; Radio frequency identification (RFID)",,,"CRC Press",,9781420055009; 1420054996; 9781420054996,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052556566

Some of the smartest network experts in the industry have drawn a map to help you navigate this journey. Their goal isn’t to predict the future but to help you design and build a network that will be ready for whatever that future holds. Because if there’s one thing the last decade has taught us, it’s that network demand will always exceed expectations. This book will help you get ready.” -Randall Stephenson, Chairman, CEO, and President of AT and T “Software is changing the world, and networks too. In this in-depth book, AT and T’s top networking experts discuss how they’re moving software-defined networking from concept to practice, and why it ’s a business imperative to do this rapidly.” -Urs Hölzle, SVP Cloud Infrastructure, Google “Telecom operators face a continuous challenge for more agility to serve their customers with a better customer experience and a lower cost. This book is a very inspiring and vivid testimony of the huge transformation this means, not only for the networks but for the entire companies, and how AT and T is leading it. It provides a lot of very deep insights about the technical challenges telecom engineers are facing today. Beyond AT and T, I’m sure this book will be extremely helpful to the whole industry.” -Alain Maloberti, Group Chief Network Officer, Orange Labs Networks “This new book should be read by any organization faced with a future driven by a “shift to software.” It is a holistic view of how AT and T has transformed its core infrastructure from hardware based to largely software based to lower costs and speed innovation. To do so, AT and T had to redefine their technology supply chain, retrain their workforce, and move toward open source user-driven innovation; all while managing one of the biggest networks in the world. It is an amazing feat that will put AT and T in a leading position for years to come.” -Jim Zemlin, Executive Director, The Linux Foundation This book is based on the lessons learned from AT and T’s software transformation journey starting in 2012 when rampant traffic growth necessitated a change in network architecture and design. Using new technologies such as NFV, SDN, Cloud, and Big Data, AT and T’s engineers outlined and implemented a radical network transformation program that dramatically reduced capital and operating expenditures. This book describes the transformation in substantial detail. The subject matter is of great interest to telecom professionals worldwide, as well as academic researchers looking to apply the latest techniques in computer science to solving telecom’s big problems around scalability, resilience, and survivability. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Big data; Computer operating systems; Metadata; Network function virtualization; Open source software; Supply chains; Cloud infrastructures; Core infrastructure; Network transformation; Software transformation; Technical challenges; Technology supply chains; Telecom professionals; User-driven innovation; Costs",,,"CRC Press",,9781351804691; 9781138631526,,Book,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052485711

New ways of buying and paying, such as electronic-commerce and mobile-banking, have become popular. Unfortunately, the security of such transactions is constantly being challenged. In spite of the recent advances in network and cloud security, there have been several identity and secure information leaks in Target, Home Depot, Apple and Sony Pictures Entertainment, etc. [1]. Many of the security breaches are due to insecure access channels to the cloud. An adversary can obtain user credentials through a counterfeited device and access the74 cloud from anywhere. The security problem is likely to be exacerbated in the Internet-of-things (IoT) era where millions of devices in our homes, offices, and cars are digitally connected. It is estimated that the number of connected devices will reach 50 billion in 2020 [2]. Every connected IoT device provides more attack possibilities and adds to the potential risk. Thus, security has to be built into all layers of the system from network and cloud layers to the IoT hardware layer. Adding to the complexity is the fact that the integrated circuit (IC)'s global and distributed supply chain has introduced hardware-based security issues, such as hardware Trojans, intellectual property (IP) piracy and IC overbuilding, reverse engineering, counterfeiting, etc. [3]. Thus, hardware trustworthiness is even more important in the IoT era. Each IoT device should be equipped with a unique device signature that can be used for authentication by the cloud [4]. © 2018 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Hardware; Integrated circuits; Internet of things; Malware; Mobile commerce; Network layers; Network security; Reverse engineering; RRAM; Supply chains; Cloud securities; Connected Devices; Electronic information exchanges; Internet of thing (IOT); Personal devices; Security breaches; Security primitives; Security problems; Hardware security",,,"CRC Press",,9781351965903; 9781138035775,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051801331

Also, European Union Law requires to provide such information by Transmission System Operators. In case of multiloop network which is supplied with many sources and different gas compositions, the dynamic network simulation combined with forecasting of behavior all sources and offtakes, is necessary. The article describes model of full chain of calculation. At entries, there are: productions, storages and interconnectors with more less stable gas compositions and LNG Terminals where gas composition smoothly change in function of time or significantly due to filing in from next vessel. At exits forecasting of demand relates to nomination processes (industrial end users) or forecasting systems (city gates to household areas). Between them the multiloop transmission network is dynamically simulated with full quality tracking model. The paper contains also our practice experience based on Polish transmission system which has many entries from production, interconnectors, storages, more than 900 exits and new LNG Terminal. The multiloop network has also several compression stations and reduction points. There is a possibility of determining the degree of gas mixing i.e. providing clients with such information with simulation software. Such analyses are executed on a regular basis. Calculations are performed in three minute cycles (reconstruction network state) and future calculation are performed with the 15-minute step. For future calculations city gate exit points demand is obtained from the forecasting system (short-term forecasts - 10 days) or nominations used in supply points or industrial exits. Such values are compared up – to – date with the values obtained from chromatographs located in the transmission system network – reference chromatographs. Finally, the article presents the case study of stream mixing degree depending on gas composition from different gas sources, exit point demand and settings of the non-linear network elements. The analyses were performed for both static and dynamic scenarios where one of the parameters is a dynamic change of the quantity and quality supply from LNG Terminal to the network. © Copyright 2017, PSIG, Inc.",,"Chromatography; Computer software; Forecasting; Mixing; Oil terminals; Transmissions; European Union Law; Forecasting system; Nomination process; Reconstruction networks; Short-term forecasts; Simulation software; Transmission system operators; Transmission systems; Gases",,,"Pipeline Simulation Interest Group (PSIG)",,,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051488490

Bitcoin is a currency issued without a trusted third party, in peer-to-peer (Peer-to-Peer) network and gives a guarantee of the reliability of money transactions, ensures the integrity of transactions. There is a back end-technique called block-chain that guarantees these without trusted third party. Block chain is a public ledger that all nodes to verify transactions and maintain integrity with the same ledger. Block chain technology applies not only electronic currency but also in various industries such as contract document integrity, cloud storage service, internet of thigns, supply chain for transaction integrity. However, there are problems to be solved if the bitcoin block chain consensus rule is applied to these industry. First, there is problem of low transaction throughput and block generation rate by an inefficient consensus rule. Second, There is problem of tampered block broadcast with non-dependency (internet of things data, food history data) transactions when applying the block chain consensus rule, which is proof-of-work of bitcoin's competitive system. To solve these problems, we propose new blockchain consensus algorithm for non-dependency transactions. In this paper, the blockchain transactions targeted internet of things data and food history. We propose consensus rule based voting for the efficiency, also propose method of imposing difficulty of block generation according to the voting result in order to prevent malicious node attacks. We provide experimental results on attack malicious node in the block chain implemented by the proposed consensus algorithms and the result is analyzed. © 2017 SERSC Australia.","Blockchain; Cold chain; Consensus rule; Internet of things; Supply chain",,,,"Science and Engineering Research Support Society",20054262,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050624453

The key performance indicators of agricultural supply chain traditionally consider three major dimensions including cost, lead time, and reliability. However, the supply chain flexibility which is an important indicator to assess the ability of all players in the agricultural supply chain can accommodate the additional demand is rarely explored. The objective of this study is to develop a mathematical programming model to assess the supply chain flexibility for cassava business. In this study, a stochastic programming approach is adopted for modeling the flexibility. The proposed model was divided into two stages. The first stage (BASE) evaluates the demand base pattern along the cassava supply chain networks. The second stage (ADD-VOL) is to assess the reserve capacity using the base pattern obtained from the first stage. The reserved capacity at each stage presents the flexibility of the supply chain that can accommodate additional demand. The proposed models could be used to identify the bottlenecks of the supply chain in order to enhance its capacity for better serving the future supply and demand changes. © 2017 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.

The diffusion absorption refrigeration (DAR) cycle is a technology of interest for cooling in rural areas and developing countries due to its low capital cost, low maintenance requirements, and unique design in which the requirement for electrically-driven components are fully omitted. The main feature of DAR systems is a thermally driven bubble pump that is used to circulate the refrigerant and absorbent fluid components around the system. In this paper, we present results from a laboratory DAR system operating over a range of pressures and heat input rates with ammonia-water-hydrogen as the working fluid.

Parties that are on the same level are usually competitors, and the companies that are linked vertically in supply chains have a trading relationship as suppliers-consumers. All the parties that are connected in the supply chain are individual entities that have self-interest and they may compete for gaining a commercial advantage. Given such complex relations the current work aims to find a mechanism for an allocation in supply chain network for the participants. This paper focuses on modelling and simulation of the supply chain formation in a network of potential participants in order to establish and enforce contract parameters between each pair of component consumer/supplier and to facilitate end-to-end contract parameters. The Supply Chain Formation problem is translated in terms of an acyclic graph where the nodes are represented by suppliers/consumers. The initial graph is then transformed in a cluster graph and by message exchange between the agents the contract parameters values are propagated along the network from the underlying suppliers towards the root. © 2017 EUROSIS-ETI.

They developed from classical intra-SCs to inter-SCs and further to flexible and more complex SC-networks. Because of globally distributed SC networks, dynamic environments and increasing customer expectations managers are faced with new challenges. The increasing complexity of SCs results in a new dimension of risks (variable, uncertain, global), that has to be considered and managed. Hence, managers are required to assess these new risks and make decisions in a very complex and dynamic environment. Therefore, methods and tools are needed to support managers in evaluating scenarios and decision making. Modeling and simulation are often used for latter purposes as they are techniques to describe, shape and investigate problems. Especially they are used to improve the problem understanding, test and compare different scenarios and make what-if analyses without influencing the real world. The focus of this paper is on the evaluation of risks along the SC, especially on the quantification of risks for further evaluation using simulation. Special attention has been given to risks related to countries. Appropriate risk indicators have been identified and discussed. The determined information provide a good basis for further simulation work. © 2017 EUROSIS-ETI.

Located in the heart of a vibrant economic zone, ASEAN countries have a combined population of 600 million and a GDP of $1.5 trillion. They generate $1.7 trillion worth of trade annually, a Figure that is likely to increase significantly if Southeast Asian countries maintain projected growth rates of 5 per cent to 6 per cent over the next few years (Cottrill and Singh, 2011). The potential for growth in the region can be traced to the significant influx of foreign investment over the last decade. Rising production costs and shrinking product life cycles have forced many multinational corporations to relocate their manufacturing facilities globally to take advantage of lower labor costs, proximity to raw materials, and new consumer markets (Phusavat and Kanchana, 2008; Inemek and Tuna, 2009; Taylor, 2009). It is regarded that ASEAN countries are fast catching up with leading developing nations, and it is not surprising that Karki et al. (2005) describe ASEAN as a dynamic economic region characterized by rapid industrialization. However, if such a vision is to be realized, one of the things that Southeast Asia must focus on is how to stimulate vibrancy among SMEs 1 in the region. Provision of sufficient working capital and liquidity for the SMEs’ supply chain operation is the key to vitalizing them because they are generally short of capital or have inadequate capability in borrowing money. Since the financial downturn in 2008, more and more SMEs in AEC are subject to overdue payment; it was reported that across the Asia Pacific, the average number of days for an invoice to be paid rose from 48 to 56 in 2014. In the same year, Singapore also failed to improve its credit terms with export customers. A total of 30 per cent of business-to-business (B2B) invoices issued to foreign companies were paid late and 6.5 per cent were written off as uncollectable. In an economy where 50 per cent of exports are traded on open account (i.e. credit terms), a rise in daily sales outstanding (DSO) affects the cash flows of local businesses (Coundouris, 2014). © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Kiyoshi Kobayashi, Khairuddin Abdul Rashid, Masahiko Furuichi and William P.

The role of the port as a Global Hub in logistics networks is probably the best known, and is indeed described in, for example, the port vision document of the port of Rotterdam. 2 A second role of the port as described in this particular document is as an industrial cluster. This refers to the location of multiple industrial activities in the port area, where preferably, synergies are achieved. For example, synergies are attained in so-called industrial ecosystems that feature the reuse of byproducts of one facility by another facility as a resource (see Chapter 16). A third role that the port plays is the Information Hub, which facilitates the exchange of information in support of international trade and logistics (see Chapter 14). Here, international trade is supported by information and communication technologies, which progressively set the standards for the global logistics systems. 3 Presently, port community systems provide information services that facilitate the exchange of information between actors involved in trade and logistics processes in and around the port. 4 A fourth role of the port is World Port City, where the development of the port and the urban area around the port area go hand in hand, and where commodity trade and business services such as legal and financial services, and maritime services add value. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Harry Geerlings, Bart Kuipers and Rob Zuidwijk; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,,"Zuidwijk, R.; Rotterdam School of Management (RSM), Netherlands","Taylor and Francis",,9781317077718; 9781472485007,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049944180

They serve mainly as a transport node, but they are also a location for industrial, trade and logistics activities. In addition, ports are part of dynamic global supply chains and part of a network with a foreland and a hinterland. This chapter deals with the hinterland transport chain of ports. Chapter 8 of this book made already clear that ports are increasingly faced with congestion and that hinterland accessibility is a key factor in competition among ports. In that chapter hinter-land accessibility or improving the efficiency of port-related transport chains was approached from an infrastructural perspective and the perspective of dynamic traffic management. This chapter approaches hinterland accessibility as an organisational issue.

The challenge ahead for supply chain managers is how to grow business profit while protecting the planet and respecting people’s rights. The significance of this issue motivates researchers in the fields of “sustainability” and “supply chain” to further integrate these concepts. To identify affected areas, and how sustainability influences them, this research has employed a literature survey of related papers published between 2012 and 2016 within 16 A* indexed journals that are relevant to Information and Computing Science, Transportation/Freight Services and Manufacturing Engineering. Findings show that sustainable supply chain network structure, impact factors, relationship integration and performance evaluation are the main research topics in these streams. The role of decision-making tools within each discipline, the key methodologies and techniques are discussed. Generally speaking, primary challenges in the sustainable supply chain domain devolve from use of inadequate decision-making tools and inappropriate information systems.

A key impediment to nimble supply chains is the level of traffic congestion experienced on U.S. roadways and the subsequent costs that are incurred because of that congestion. To facilitate the development of a methodology for quantifying congestion, a standardized approach is presented for calculating congestion figures that are comparative on a year-over-year basis. With this methodology, time delays on the National Highway System in 2014 were calculated at more than 728 million hours, equating to approximately $49.6 billion in increased congestion-related costs to the trucking industry. The congestion was heavily concentrated in urban areas, with 88.1% of the total cost occurring on only 17.6% of the National Highway System network. The lost productivity is equivalent to 264,781 commercial truck drivers sitting idle for an entire working year. Additionally, the average truck experienced an increased cost of $4,546 because of congestion, a figure that varied widely depending on the number of miles a particular truck traveled in a particular area. Finally, the presented standardized methodology enables 2014 to be used as a base year for comparison with future years, allowing for the monitoring of congestion effects over time. As a result, transportation planners and managers can evaluate system metrics such as planning efficiency and productivity for a longer time. The methodology also supports assessment of shorter-term events, such as natural disasters and infrastructure improvement projects. © 2017 National Academy of Sciences.",,"Commercial vehicles; Disasters; Efficiency; Highway systems; Managers; Productivity; Supply chains; Traffic congestion; Truck drivers; Truck transportation; Trucks; Urban planning; Commercial trucks; Infrastructure improvements; Lost productivities; Natural disasters; Public and private sector; Sustainable economic growth; Transportation managers; Transportation planners; Costs",,"Torrey, W.F.; American Transportation Research Institute, 950 North Glebe Road, Suite 210, United States; email: ftorrey@trucking.org","SAGE Publications Ltd",03611981,,TRRED,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048953652

Methods: Based on the reliability analysis of the supply chain, this paper introduces the importance measure to analyze the influences of supply chain members on the entire system. Then the importance values of different supply chain members are compared, and weaknesses recognition of the supply chain is analyzed. Results: According to the importance values of different members in supply chain networks, when the members have the same shortage rates, the importance in the series position is larger, and the manufacturer has the most effect on the supply chain systems.

Thus, in order to cope with their stochastic components, simulation methods and techniques are frequently employed in the analysis of complex systems related to these sectors. However, simulation is not an optimization tool, so it needs to be combined with optimization methods whenever the goal is to maximize the system performance or to minimize the associated costs. A large number of these real-life optimization problems are N P-hard and large scale in nature, which makes it necessary the use of metaheuristic approaches to solve them in an efficient way. This paper provides an introductory tutorial to simheuristic algorithms, i.e.: The combination of simulation methods with metaheuristics to efficiently deal with stochastic optimization problems. After motivating the need for simheuristics in today’s world and reviewing some related work, a series of key methodological and computational aspects are discussed in detail. Then, several examples of application to different industries are provided. The paper also describes open research lines and future trends in this emerging area. © 2017 OR Society.

Main focus are end-of-life cell phones and printed circuit boards from server and network electronics. To date the material specific recycling is focused on mass stream concepts such as shredder processes and metallurgy to extract the high-value metallic constituents, i.e. copper, gold and silver. However, a series of critical elements cannot be recovered efficiently or is even lost in dust or residual fractions. The goal of ADIR is to demonstrate the feasibility of a key technology for next generation urban mining in the scope of reverse production concepts. An automated disassembly of electronic equipment is worked out to separate and recover valuable materials. The concept is based on image processing, robotic handling, pulsed power technology, 3D laser measurement, real-time laser material identification (to detect materials by laser spectroscopy), laser processing (to selectively unsolder these; to cut off parts of a printed circuit board), and automatic separation into different sorting fractions. A data base is built up providing comprehensive information about physical and chemical features of the items to be treated. A machine concept was worked out being capable to selectively disassemble printed circuit boards and cell phones with short cycle times to gain sorting fractions containing high amounts of valuable materials. Examples are those materials with high economic importance and supply risk such as tantalum, tungsten and neodymium. The various processes for the ADIR demonstrator have been developed recently and will now be implemented in a set of interlinked machines to validate the novel process chain for reverse production. The current state of development will be highlighted.

The use of temporary or outsourced work or falsely self-employed workers is a common strategy to drive down costs. Poorly monitored international labour recruitment agencies, in both the migrants’ countries of origin and in the destination states, often overcharge migrant workers, deceive them about their working conditions, or fail to assist them if they encounter workplace abuse (ITUC 2016a; HRW 2016). Recent tragedies in Bangladesh, Cambodia and Pakistan have exposed appalling working conditions in parts of GSCs together with violations of workers’ human rights. The effective punishment of corporate human rights abuses however remains a distant dream. The fact that 90 percent of forced labour cases are estimated to take place in the private sector (ILO 2009: 47; ILO 2012: 13; UN 2012: 4) calls for urgent attention to the legal accountability of business actors involved in abuses or benefiting from labour or services provided by trafficked persons, including through their supply chains. To date, the responsibility of companies for the acts of their subsidiaries or suppliers is largely governed by voluntary guidelines, such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (OECD MNE Guidelines) (OECD 2011) or the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UN Guiding Principles) (UN 2011), and by a vast network of corporate and multi-stakeholder codes of conduct. Yet there has been little tried and tested “hard” law for holding companies responsible for their own contributions to violations overseas, let alone for the acts of subsidiaries and contractors. This chapter analyses barriers to effective remedies for trafficked victims with a focus on GSCs. It begins by identifying the various obstacles to holding MNEs liable before staking out some possible venues for imposing liability to ensure greater accountability on the part of corporations. The chapter concludes with an assessment of the anti-trafficking framework for ensuring justice for those working in forced labour in GSCs specifically in the context of the EU while also presenting legal strategies for the global trade union movement for getting corporations to be more accountable for human rights and labour rights abuses. © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,,,"Muskat-Gorska, Z.; Legal Department International Trade Union ConfederationBelgium","Cambridge University Press",,9781316675809; 9781107160545,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048103535

Exfiltration and/or modification of data is also a risk for space systems. Although the attack surface to space systems (supply chain, ground systems, networks, user terminals) is usually well protected, there is a high motivation for adversaries to seek out potential vulnerabilities on the spacecraft. Spacecraft architectures are typically based on heritage subsystems of hardware/software/firmware including real-time operating systems, embedded processors, shared bus architectures, and custom ASICs. These systems are highly redundant and resilient to component failures, since operation in the space environment of 15+ years is typical. However, spacecraft architectures were typically not designed with the cyber threat in mind. Well known cyber threat concepts (malware, privilege elevation, root-kits, system pivots, stack overflow, man-in-the-middle, reconnaissance) should now be considered when designing cyber defense for the spacecraft. A unique challenge for spacecraft cyber defense is the potential for denial-of-service attacks through the “safe mode” of the spacecraft. A cyber resilient spacecraft that is under attack will continue mission critical activities, initiate defensive measures, and “operate through” the attack without a trigger to a non-operational “safe mode” state. The Aerospace Corporation and Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute (SEI) are researching new approaches to spacecraft flight software for cyber resilient operations. This research includes: cyber threats relevant to the space environment, strengths and potential vulnerabilities for typical flight code processing, runtime assurance, analytics & detection, autonomous defense, and cyber assurance in the software lifecycle. Concepts will likely have application for avionics, SCADA, and other real-time operating environments. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

However, when firms must distribute their products to a significant number of customers daily, mathematical programming models become impractical because of the large number of input parameters that must be included and the large number of output variables that are generated in the model. The objective of this work is to show a prototype methodology of model generation developed to obtain an optimal solution of the vehicle routing following a three steps procedure: Clustering, Routing, and Partitioning. For optimization, a two-phase mathematical modeling, solved by means of mixed integer mathematical programming, was used, as a variant of the solution method of the VRP and MDVRP problem.

Demand uncertainties are calibrated using a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) process. The spline interpolation (SI) method and curve fitting process have been utilized to obtain parameters of the constructed GBM-based differential equation over the product’s life cycle (PLC). The constructed stochastic differential equation is coded as the forecast model and is simulated using MATLAB. The results are several sample demand paths generated from simulation of the forecast model. To evaluate the forecasting performance of the proposed method it is compared with Holt’s model, using actual data from the semiconductor industry. The comparison results confirm the applicability of the proposed method in the semiconductor industry. The method can be helpful for policy-makers who require the prediction of uncertain demand over a time horizon, such as decisions associated with aggregate production planning, capacity planning, and supply chain network design. Especially for the semiconductor industry with intensive capital investment the proposed approach can be useful for making decisions associated with capacity allocation and expansion. © 2017 The Author(s).

It looks into the degree of intra-ASEAN and extra-ASEAN vertical integration vis-à-vis North America, East Asia, and the European Union through the measurement of value-added creation-absorption in global value chains (GVC) and by locating ASEAN within vertical structures. The study employs an international input-output database and breaks up gross exports into different components of value-added using data from 1997, 2004, and 2012. ASEAN has made significant gains in integrating with East Asia. However, ASEAN as a single production region has gained little, and even lost share in value-added trade with NAFTA and Europe. The truth is that ASEAN has a stronger role across the GVC as a supplier of intermediate goods (33%) than as a supplier of final goods (30%). Vertical structures represent more than 43% of ASEAN gross exports, but it still depends on foreign parts and components (35%) to produce its exports.

The refineries are interlinked with a network of pipelines that allow transfer of utilities, intermediate and finished products stream and thus achieve high level of integration. The company handles about 110 intermediate streams in all the refineries and 6-18 different products are blended on daily basis. Also, both Refineries in Ruwais Area are linked to the neighboring companies for further integration of specific streams like fuel gas, blending components and intermediate streams. The main Petroleum Products produced are LPG, Propylene, Naphtha, Gasoline, Gasoil, Jet Fuel, fuel Oil, Base oils and soon we will produce Carbon Black and Calcined Coke. These products are sold in the local market as well are exported. Different grades are produced to meet both markets. The company also operates Primary Product Supply Terminal in Abu Dhabi and a vast pipeline network (total combined length that is close to 2,000 kms) to form the main hub of supplying the finished petroleum products to the local market of Abu Dhabi emirate. It also operates General Utilities Plant (GUP) at Ruwais Industrial area that supplies different utilities (includes Power, Sea water, Potables water, etc.) to Ruwais Refineries as well as other industrial complexes of all the major companies and ADNOC Housing Complex at Ruwais area. Furthermore, it operates Industrial Waste Management facility ""Beaat"" at Ruwais Industrial area that receives all the industrial waste from all ADNOC Companies for further disposal, incineration, landfill, etc. Operating such highly complex operation and with the current highly competitive market, it necessitates the need to put more focus to identify areas of profitability improvement and stretch the Dollar to the last cent.

In addition to the post-fabrication authentication techniques (e.g., IP metering), various hardware hardening approaches have emerged to resist reverse engineering and IP piracy. This chapter reviews three representable security hardening approaches—camouflaging, logic encryption/locking, and design obfuscation—that are applied to ICs at layout, gate, and register transfer levels. Particularly, this chapter presents a dynamic state-deflection-based obfuscation method, which deflects the state transition from the original transition path to a black hole cluster if an invalid key is applied to the hardware IP. This obfuscation method can successfully thwart the reverse engineering attack that exploits the code analysis support from electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Furthermore, this chapter extends the idea of design obfuscation for two-dimensional IC to emerging three-dimensional (3D) IC design technology. The proposed method is based on the insertion of a Network-on-Chip (NoC)-based shielding plane between two commercial dies to build the secure 3D ICs without involvement of trustworthy foundries. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","3D integration; Camouflaging; Design obfuscation; Hardware attacks; Hardware security; Intellectual property piracy; Logic encryption; Logic locking; Metering; Network-on-chip; Reverse engineering",,,"Yu, Q.; University of New HampshireUnited States; email: qiaoyan.yu@unh.edu","Springer International Publishing",,9783319490250; 9783319490243,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042821160

The consumption of natural gas in the power generation and transportation is anticipated to increase as new gas sources emerge and new gas processing technologies are developed. Ecological gas sources, e.g., biogas or synthetic natural gas, are also steadily gaining popularity in local distributed production. A potential injection of gas from such sources to a gas pipeline should be considered in the design and operation of new gas networks. Mathematical modelling and optimization can contribute to the decision making in such tasks. A linearized model of a pipeline distribution problem has been developed for optimal network design and operation, providing information about the structure of the gas distribution network and its operation conditions. The model, which is based on a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, is illustrated by studying a future gas network, with the option of connecting new gas suppliers and consumers, minimizing the overall costs (including cost of fuel, cost of new pipeline connections, and cost of compression). Seasonal variations in the demand and supply are considered by a multi-period formulation of the problem. The results give information about the optimal connections and gas flows, including the flow directions in the pipe segments, gas supply rates and pressure level in the pipeline. The results for a case study are presented and analyzed, paying special attention to the effect of constrained gas sources on the optimal design of the network. © 2017 IMEKO","Biogas; Gas supply chain; Linearization; MILP; Natural gas; Optimization","Biogas; Costs; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Gas supply; Gases; Integer programming; Linearization; Natural gas; Optimization; Pipelines; Supply chains; Design and operations; Distributed productions; Distribution problem; Gas distribution network; MILP; Mixed integer linear programming (MILP); Optimal network design; Synthetic natural gas; Natural gas transportation","","Mikolajková, M.; Åbo Akademi UniversityFinland; email: marketa.mikolajkova@abo.fi","International Measurement Confederation (IMEKO)",,,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042601597

This chapter attempts to argue that a deep and broad KB leads to better GI outcomes. In addition, the theoretical model proposes that firms that invest and involve themselves in RL mechanisms are more likely to indirectly foster GI. Also, we argue how cooperation among firms that occurs through networks or supply chains stimulates the RL mechanisms, eventually affecting the innovation. In light of the knowledge-based view (KBV) and the relationship view (RV), the two main propositions suggest that firm’s GI is greatly influenced both by an integrated broad and deep KB (directly) as the RL activities (indirectly). The proposed research model has conceptual implications (advancing in the application of RV perspective in the field of GI) and practical implications for managers (related to the design and improvement of his or her KB and the engagement in RL strategies). © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","External Knowledge; Green Innovation; Knowledge Base; Knowledge Integration; Tacit Knowledge",,"MICINN","Leal-Millán, A.; Universidad de SevillaSpain; email: aleal@us.es","Springer",21975698,,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042262854

This paper highlights the problem from the perspective of dynamic and discrete networks. A topological structure model with the characteristics of dynamic and discreteness is used to describe the structure of military supply chain networks (MSCNs). In order to provide a platform for evaluating the effectiveness, simulation algorithms based on topological structure models for MSCNs are presented. Considering military and economic factors, evaluation metrics including supply capability and supply efficiency are proposed. By applying the model and algorithms to a POL supply network in a theater, we obtain the values of supply capability and efficiency metrics in a dynamic environment. We also identify an optimal solution from multiple feasible solutions to help decision-makers to make scientific and rational decisions by using exploratory analysis method. The results show that new evaluation metrics can capture important effectiveness requirements for military supply networks positively.

Micro-planning using an android phone-based app was undertaken to map out the target population and logistics in all the counties 4 weeks to the campaign implementation instead of 6 months as per the WHO recommendation. The outcomes of the micro-planning exercise were a detailed micro-plan that served as a guide in ensuring that every eligible individual in the population was vaccinated with potent vaccine. A national Trainer of Trainers training was done to equip key officers with new knowledge and skills in developing micro-plans at all levels. The micro planning was done using a mobile phone app, the doforms that enabled data to be transmitted real time to the national level. The objective of the study was to establish whether use of mobile phone app would contribute to quality of sub national micro plans that can be used for national level planning and implementation of the campaign. Methods: there were 9 data collection forms but only forms 1-7 were to be uploaded onto the app. Forms 8A and 9A were to be filled but were to remain at the implementation level for use intra campaign. The forms were coded; Form 1A&B, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A, 8A and 9A The Village form (form 1A&B) captured information by household which included village names, name of head of household, cell phone contact of head of household, number of children aged 9 months to 14years in the household, possible barriers to reaching the children, appropriate vaccination strategy based on barriers identified and estimated or proposed number of teams and type. This was the main form and from this every other form picked the population figures to estimate other supplies and logistics. On advocacy, communication and social mobilization the information collected included mobile network coverage, public amenities such as churches, mosques and key partners at the local level. On human resource and cold chain supplies the information collected included number of health facilities by type, number of health workers by cadre in facilities within the village, number of vaccine carriers and icepacks by size, refrigerators and freezers. All these forms were to be uploaded onto the phone app. except form 8A, the individual team plan, which was to be used during implementation at the local level. Android phone application, doforms, was used to capture data. Training on micro planning, data entry and doforms app was conducted at National, County, Sub-county and ward levels using standardized guidelines. An interactive case study was used in all the trainings to facilitate understanding. The App was also available on Laptops through its provided web-application. The app allowed multiple users to log in concurrently. Feedback on all the variables were obtained from the team at the Ward level. The ward level team included education officers or teachers, village elders, community health workers and other community stakeholders. Only the Ward level was allowed to collect information on paper and that information was subsequently transferred to the phone-based app, doforms, by health information officers. The national, county and sub county were able to access their data from the app using a password provided by the administrator. Results: real time data was received from 46 of 47 counties. One county (Marsabit) did not participate in the micro plan process. Over 97% (283/290) of the sub counties responded and shared various information via the app. Different data forms had different completion rates. There was 100% completion rate for the data on villages and target population. Much valuable information was shared but there was no time for the national and county level to interrogate and harmonize for proper implementation. The information captured during the campaign can be used for routine immunization and other community based interventions. Electronic data collection not only provided the number of children but provided the locations also where these children could be found. Conclusion: despite the limitations of time to harmonize the micro plans with the national plan, the micro planning process was a great success with 46/47 counties responding through the mobile phone app. Not only did it provide the numbers of the target children, it further provided the places where these children could be found. There was timely data transfer, data integrity, tracking, real time data visualization reporting and analysis. The app enabled real time feedback to national focal point by data entry clerks as well as enabling trouble shooting by the administrator. This ensured campaign planning was done from the lowest level to the national level. © Amina Ismail et al.","Cost; County; Doforms; Management; Micro plan; Phone app; Sub county; Wards","measles vaccine; rubella vaccine; vaccine; adolescent; child; human; infant; Kenya; measles; mobile application; mobile phone; preschool child; preventive health service; procedures; rubella; vaccination; Adolescent; Cell Phone; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Immunization Programs; Infant; Kenya; Measles; Measles Vaccine; Mobile Applications; Rubella; Rubella Vaccine; Vaccination; Vaccines, Combined","MOH","Ismail, A.; American Red CrossUnited States","African Field Epidemiology Network",19378688,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042066406

By analyzing two main trends of studies in the field of supply network management, components of supply network are classified into structural and infrastructural factors. Also a comparison is made to identify the difference between supply network and traditionally factory-based manufacturing system. Based on the literature review, a conceptual framework is further proposed which describes the supply network from four essential perspectives: Role/function, Relationship/alliance, Configuration/reconfiguration, and Risk and crisis management.

This study empirically validates the effects of the three critical constructs on overall supply chain risk exposure. The limitations of this study can be seen in the use of perceptual data from single informants and the focus on automotive firms in a single country. The detailed operationalization of the constructs sheds further light on the major risk sources, drivers, and mitigation strategies in supply chain networks.

The traditional supply chain was managed with the objectives to reduce cost without focusing on environmental and social dimensions. However with passage of time institutional pressures has directed firms to design supply chain network which takes care of environmental and social dimensions as well. Green supply chain management concept has evolved gradually over a period of time. The main reason behind evolution of green supply chain management is conservation of natural resources which human beings ignored for long. Published reports show that major portion of the energy is supplied by fossil fuels and thereby depletion of natural resources is occurring at an accelerating rate with time. Industrial manufacturing report also suggest that demand for manufacturing products is likely to double by the year 2050. This will result in high generation of pollutants and gases. If the greenhouse gases emissions remain unchecked, then it will create a catastrophic effect by 2050. Globally manufacturers and industry associations are now acting proactively to conserve the natural resources and curb greenhouse gases emissions. The level of popularity of green supply chain management can be estimated from the high research output in leading operations journals such as IJPE, IJPR, Resources, Conservation and Recycling Journals. © 2018 by IGI Global.

Economic, environmental, and social impacts of landfills have motivated interest in the sustainable utilization of the MSW in order to bring values. This can be attained by exploring possible production of valuable products from the MSW constituents. In this study, we cover the MSW supply chain network through different echelons under uncertainty. The first echelon represents collection/transfer stations where the tasks of MSW collection and sorting the MSW into its constituents or sub-waste are performed. The second echelon represents locations where the sub-wastes are distributed to several technologies in order to produce valuable products. In the third echelon, these products are distributed to several markets to satisfy products demand. A stochastic two stage MILP model is formulated to examine the effects of the model parameter uncertainties. Due to the model complexity, a Bender decomposition algorithm is developed to find the model optimal solution.

Vivek Kale is a master of simplifying the complex world of network theory and its relevance to business.” -Jagdish N. Sheth, Charles H. Kellstadt Professor of Marketing, Emory University Agile Network Businesses: Collaboration, Coordination, and Competitive Advantage reflects the shift from traditional networks to virtual and agile networks that enable businesses to operate dynamically, thereby representing markets more closely. This book enables IT managers and business decision-makers to understand clearly what network businesses and enterprises are, what they can do for them, and how to realize them. Customers in geographically dispersed markets are demanding higher quality products in a greater variety, at lower cost, and in a shorter time. Thus, enterprises have moved from a few centralized and vertically integrated facilities to geographically dispersed networks of capabilities, competencies and resources, which are the core of network businesses. Enterprises are now constructing more fluid network businesses in which each member facility focuses on differentiation and relies increasingly on its partners, suppliers, and customers to provide the rest. Network businesses have emerged as an organizational paradigm for collaboration and coordination across loosely connected individual organizations. This pragmatic book: Introduces network solutions and distributed systems that are a first step towards enabling a network enterprise. It also gives a detailed description of networks and agent system that have paved the road to network enterprises. Describes the basics of service-oriented architecture (SOA), cloud computing, and big data that are essential to network enterprises. Details the distinguishing aspects of network enterprises, which include virtual enterprises, management of network enterprises, and collaborative network enterprises. Covers such major application areas as supply, manufacturing, e-business, platform, social and wireless sensor networks. Introduces decision networks in the context of supply chain networks This book reinterprets the traditional supply chain in terms of the flow of decisions, information, and materials, which leads to reconfiguring the traditional supply chain network into mutually separate decision networks (e.g., fourth-party logistics or 4PL), information networks (e.g., wireless sensor networks), and logistics networks (e.g., third-party logistics or 3PL). © 2018 by Vivek Kale CRC Press is an imprint of Taylor & Francis Group, an Informa business.",,,,"Kale, V.; Essar Group, India","CRC Press",,9781498748346; 9781498748322,,Book,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041511970

The search for more sustainable system for maritime-hinterland transportation has culminated in the development of the synchromodality concept. In this study, mathematical model is formulated and used to experiment the feasibility and applicability of the concept of synchromodality in Ghana. Data for the numerical analysis for the given corridor is obtained from online sources and through the direct interview of experts in the field. Coupled with this, expert judgment of the researchers is also used. The results of the optimisation were plotted in a graph using OriginPro 9.0, 32-Bit Software. From the study results, the synchromodal service design yielded a difference of about 22% cost savings compared with the unimodal service due to the usage of fewer of trucks. The waiting penalty at the terminal of origin is also considerably reduced. When compared with the intermodal service, the synchromodal service offered a cost savings of about 8%.The results of this research show that the innovative concept has the potentials of ensuring sustainability, flexibility and cost reduction among other things, in freight transportation sector. The sustainability is obtained through better modal split and parallel use of modes for maritime-hinterland freight transportation. Furthermore, the study reveals that synchromodality has the potentials of increasing transport service utilisation. The benefits of environmental sustainability are achieved through less usage of trucks resulting in a reduction in environmental pollution, road congestion, noise, etc. © 2018 The Author(s).

However, in reality, transportation links are subject to various sorts of disruptions. Furthermore, in most supply chain models, there is little consideration given to the diminishing value of the product. In this paper, we have designed an integrated supply chain network for perishable products that takes into account random disruptions in transportation links. We also consider several capacitated manufacturing facilities and retail outlets and stochastic demands. This model considers both demand and process uncertainty (which is incorporated through random disruptions in the transportation link between the manufacturers and the retailers), simultaneously. The model also investigates the manufacturer’s facility locations and shipment decisions in the supply chain and minimizes the total cost of the entire supply chain. The paper discusses the model output through a numerical example and we observe that the resilient model (the model considering transportation link disruptions) and the disruption free model yields different designs. Finally, the paper provides an extensive statistical analysis of disruption uncertainties in the supply chain.","Disruptions; Integrated supply chain; Network design; Perishable products; Uncertainty analysis","Manufacture; Product design; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Disruptions; Integrated supply chain; Integrated supply chain networks; Manufacturing facility; Network design; Perishable product; Process uncertainties; Supply chain network; Uncertainty analysis",,,"Newswood Limited",20780958,9789881404770,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041186097

With industrial growth becoming jobless, the need for new models of social innovation is being felt all around the world to provide jobs to the youth, skills for the new economy and entrepreneurial opportunities for transforming resources and skills. The persistence of some of these unmet needs (also referred as wicked problems sometimes) or unaddressed problems for a long time shows that the existing institutional arrangements are inadequate for the purpose. Innovations are imperative. A socio-ecological system that recognizes and rewards innovation can withstand many external shocks, provided it is agile and innovates quickly to remain responsive to emergent challenges (Anderies, Janssen, & Ostrom. Ecology and society, 9(1)2004). Whether corporations will follow an open innovation approach to blend grassroots ideas and innovations with their expertise in a reciprocal, responsible and respectful manner (Gupta et al., Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity 2: 16, 2016) is still an open question. The design of appropriatemanufacturing and frugal supply chain will then become closely linked with other features of open innovation ecosystem. The debate on the role of social innovation in multi-stakeholder context in European focused on how these innovations fostered trust among different actors and influenced policy (Defourny and Nyssens. Social Enterprise Journal 4: 202-228, 2008). In this paper, we describe the market and social forces which influence the emergence of social innovations through various processes. We then look into the evolutionary pathways for social innovations (Mulgan, Innovations 1: 145-162, 2006), to avoid inertia and spur initiatives to bridge the social gap in an inclusive manner through mobilization of youth in particular. The ecosystem for social open innovations provides scope for connecting corporations and communities (Herrera, 2015; Gibson-Graham and Roelvink, Social innovation for community economies: how, 2013). Following the theory of reciprocal and responsible open innovation systems (Gupta et al., Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity 2: 16, 2016), we explore the way barriers are overcome on the way to reach the base of economic pyramid [BOEP] customer. Technological adaptability and institutional or market adaptability are explored to understand how communities get empowered to deal with corporations through an open innovation platform. The corporations need to be empowered to understand the decision heuristics followed by grassroots and community frugal innovators (Gupta, Innovations 1: 49-66, 2006). Just as communities need to be empowered to negotiate fair and just exchange relationship with corporations (Honey Bee Network, 1990-2017). Finally, we conclude with the recommendations based on the experiences of grassroots innovators that can enrich both social innovations and social enterprises following commercial as well as social business models for meeting the unmet needs of the disadvantage section of the society. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,,"Gupta, A.; SRISTI, India; email: anilgb@gmail.com","MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute",21998531,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041014610

A multistage based logistics or SCM network can be modeled by means of a sequence of stages, each consisting of a set of functions, i.e. the existing or potential facilities located in several countries or regions of the world where goods are transformed or manufactured or stocked and delivered: Suppliers, plants, distribution centers (DCs) and customers. The structure of each stage of the supply chain is completed by a set of arcs connected to the nodes and representing the flow of goods: Each arc has a weight proportional to the cost incurred in between the two nodes it connects together. In this paper, we survey a recent advance on hybrid priority-based genetic algorithms for solving a multistage logistics or SCM network problems. In particular, the following multistage based logistics or SCM network models will be introduced: 1) the sugarcane SCM network model, 2) flexible multistage logistics network model and 3) multiobjective reverse logistics network model. In each model, we summarize the background, mathematical model, genetic algorithm and numerical experiment. We also enhance a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) by combining a local search (LS) technique and tuning GA parameters by a fuzzy logic control (FLC) to fast the search ability of GA.

As the premise of determining actual demand, occupancy information has a significant impact on building heating, cooling and ventilation in building control and energy auditing. In this paper, a Wi-Fi probe based occupancy detection method is applied to detect the occupancy in typical office buildings. Given the Wi-Fi coverage and smart devices are widely used in modern buildings, Wi-Fi probe requires no initial investment and could scan the Internet connection request and response of occupants. Previous studies suggest time-series and stochastic characteristics of occupancy information, this research proposed a Time-Window based Markov Chain (TWMC) model to detect occupancy. An on-site experiment was conducted in this study to validate the proposed method. The results report an accuracy of over 80% (x-accuracy when x equals 4). Compared to actual occupancy profile, the proposed model shows over 88% of supply air amount reduction in energy simulation with an absolute deviation less than 20%. By integrating the proposed TWMC model based on Wi-Fi probe and demand-based control system, the energy consumption of HVAC system could be significantly reduced. © 2017 The Authors.

With these technologies, SCM teams can build complex models of a supply chain or systems of supply chains using a data-driven approach. With the growth of aviation domain across the world, there has been increasing demand in aircraft for airlines and other customers. In this domain, SCM teams deal with complex networked supply chains for aircraft's spare part purchase and delivery for aircraft's maintenance and repair. Aircraft's spare parts are shipped to single assembly hubs, located globally. All parts come with certain life expectancy, specific requirements and maintenance attributes. With thousands of spare parts, hundreds of parameters, and number of manufactures distributed globally, SCM team need to deal with very large amount of data. In this paper, we use an industrial scenario of aviation industry SCM to demonstrate the necessity of having decentralized system based on distributed data-driven application technologies such as Blockchain, not only to assist in maintaining inventory of the aircraft's parts but also to monitor the performance, usage, etc. This will help to achieve a transparent network of supply chain for aircraft's parts and reduce the risk of availability of aircraft's parts in black market.

In an era of rapid technological change and devolved governance, innovation occurs in policy design and implementation as well as in the more familiar domains associated with new products, processes, materials, and markets. Innovation is a factor in how resilient firms, intermediaries, and supply chains face shifting market conditions and absorb new technology. This chapter describes two key intersections between resilience and innovation: innovative governance characterized by policy diffusion networks, and regional economic ecosystems characterized by open innovation. The discussion of policy diffusion networks is based on an analysis of the scope, character, and geographic distribution of such networks since 2011. The discussion of open innovation and regional economic ecosystems relies on an industry case study of “smart cities” as an enabling industry defined by the integration of information and communications technologies with urban infrastructure deployment. The combination of these two empirical cases of evolving mechanisms of and for technology diffusion into cities-as places and as institutions-highlights the intersections between resilience and innovation. © Nick Williams and Tim Vorley 2017., All rights reserved.",,,,"Clark, J.; School of Public Policy, United States","Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.",,9781785367649; 9781785367632,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040704840

The increasing number of producing wells, in addition to re-fractured wells, impose the need for optimizing field development strategies and shale gas supply chain networks that maximize profitability. Moreover, operators must account for undulating natural gas demands both locally and externally in a persistently low oil price environment. In this paper, we adopt supervised machine learning approaches to forecast local natural gas demand as well as guide well re-frac candidature. Both serve as critical inputs for maximizing the net present value of any shale gas field development project. An optimized water management structure is also incorporated in the proposed framework to account for associated produced-water recycling. Considering a shale gas network in the Marcellus play, supply chain optimization was achieved using a mixed integer non-linear programming formulation. The Strategic Planning model relies on at least 4 major efforts including reservoir simulation, which in turn relies on output from a feed forward Neural Network (NN) algorithm. The trained NN algorithm was deemed suitable for recommending re-frac candidates, necessary decision variables for multiphase reservoir simulation. Finally, NPV optimization relied on a fourlayer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network, developed for forecasting local shale gas demand. Both neural network algorithms were scripted using python. 17 non-redundant parameters were mined for 250 wells in the case study. The t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding technique was used to visualize related low dimensional manifolds within the highdimensional data set, and a NN algorithm was used to obtain probabilities of misclassification. The wellpads in the case study superstructure are modeled using compositional reservoir simulation. Each reservoir model is tuned by history matching production and pressure data for designated producing wells. Alternative field development strategies (including re-fracturing) are then simulated for a 10-year planning horizon to generate gas and water rate decline profiles. Using the LSTM developed, local gas demand is forecasted using data sets created from multivariate time-dependent local and global variables affecting shale gas demand. The LSTM algorithm is derived by convolving some features from the raw data set, with finedtuned weights, with the objective of minimizing a pre-defined demand error function. The results obtained show that application of this integrated approach can give operators a calculated advantage, preventing erroneous feedback of project profitability but allowing early time decision-making that maximizes shale asset NPV.

Those revolutionary, original and efficient takeaway services, such as Just-eat, Deliveroo, Deliver Hero and others, gained popularity both for their business success and for class actions related to the employment conditions. In this paper, we first analyse how do these emerging companies work, providing a special focus on the logistics aspects. In particular, we analyse the operations related to the order pick-up and delivery process, performed relying on large networks of self-employed contractors (i.e. bike drivers). Analysing the network, we recognise as a critical factor the location from where the carriers depart for performing the service. In fact, the carrier has a limited time to pick up and deliver the orders; thus, the distances between the carrier's departing point, the restaurants and the customers play a substantial role in determining the service offer. We formulate an optimization model that provides insights into the network design process. The model is an extension of the maximal covering location problem aimed to determine the location and the number of carriers' departing points. The objective function is to maximise the demand covered. This model can be further extended to include other service aspects.","Cover model; Food delivery optimization; Supply chain network design; Urban logistics",,,,"AIDI - Italian Association of Industrial Operations Professors",22838996,,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040449490

Existing regional tide-surge models perform well at the open coast but their low spatial resolution makes their forecasts less reliable for ports located in estuaries. In December 2013, a tidal surge in the North Sea with an estimated return period of 760 years partially flooded the Port of Immingham in the Humber estuary, on the UK east coast. Damage to critical infrastructure caused several weeks of disruption to vital supply chains and highlighted a need for additional forecasting tools to supplement national surge warnings. In this paper, we show that Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can generate better short-term forecasts of extreme water levels at estuarine ports. Using Immingham as a test case, an ANN is configured to simulate the tidal surge residual using an input vector that includes observations of surge at distant tide gauges in NW Scotland, wind and atmospheric pressure, and the predicted astronomical tide at Immingham. The forecast surge time-series, combined with the astronomical tide, provides a boundary condition for a local high-resolution 2D hydrodynamic model that predicts flood extent and damage potential across the port. Although the forecasting horizon of the ANN is limited, 6 to 24 hour forecasts at Immingham achieve an accuracy comparable to or better than the UK national tide-surge model and at far less computational cost. Use of a local rather than a larger regional hydrodynamic model means that potential inundation can be simulated very rapidly at high spatial resolution. Validation against the 2013 surge shows that the hybrid ANN-hydrodynamic model generates realistic flood extents that can inform port resilience planning. © 2017 The Author(s).","Artificial Neural Network; extreme water levels; ports; resilience planning; storm surge; Telemac","Atmospheric pressure; Estuaries; Floods; Fluid dynamics; Forecasting; Hydrodynamics; Image resolution; Learning systems; Neural networks; Storms; Supply chains; Tide gages; Water levels; 2D hydrodynamic models; Computational costs; Computational hydrodynamics; High spatial resolution; ports; Short-term forecasts; Storm surges; Telemac; Weather forecasting","NERC: NE/N01295X/1","French, J.; Coastal and Estuarine Research Unit, Gower Street, United Kingdom; email: j.french@ucl.ac.uk","Elsevier B.V.",22109838,,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040221176

Managers in many companies have realized that a well-designed supply chain (SC) can improve the companies’ performance in the market. Thus, a lot of companies start to focus on CLSC issues including remanufacturing, refurbishing, recycling, and disposal of end-of-life products. The body of literature on CLSC management has been overwhelmingly dominated by noncooperative studies. In order to fill up this gap in the literature, we deal with an allied SC network in cooperative environment. With the implementation of allied SCs, companies not only maximize their profit but also minimize their various costs and become more flexible and efficient in the market. Following this motivation, we develop a decentralized multilevel CLSC model for allied SCs. At the first decision level, the plants in allied SCs are considered as the upper-level DMs of the Stackelberg game. At the second level, raw material suppliers, common suppliers, assembly centers, and common collection centers are considered as the lower-level DMs of the Stackelberg game. In order to tackle each decision-maker (DM)’s unique objectives, we propose a new fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-based interactive fuzzy programming (IFP) approach. In the IFP approach, upper-level DMs determine the minimum satisfactory level for their own objectives, and by using this value, the lower DMs evaluate their own satisfactory level. A compromise solution can be derived until termination conditions are satisfied. The primary aim of this study is to design a decentralized CLSC network in cooperative environment and to propose a novel IFP approach. Finally, a numerical example is implemented and analyzed in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,,"TÜBITAK","Paksoy, T.; Department of Industrial Engineering, Turkey; email: dr.tpaksoy@gmail.com","Springer International Publishing",19316828,,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040070528

HBCUs lag behind their peer non-HBCUs because historically they have been under-served and were originally established largely as teaching and blue collar trade schools. Increased involvement in research oriented activities such as technology transfer will likely enable HBCUs to grow into new or stronger research institutions. The literature review revealed several problem areas with non-HBCUs university technology transfer include a resource planning issues. These problem areas for non-HBCUs would be challenging for HBCUs as well. Problems with university technology transfer have led to unethical behavior among faculty inventors and university technology transfer specialists at non-HBCUs (C. Hamilton, Schumann, D., 2016). Despite these problems, the non-HBCUs are generating licensing revenues. Systems dynamics is the process of combining the theory, method and philosophy necessary to analyze the behavior of a system in order to provide a common foundation that can be applied whenever it is desired to understand and influence how things change over time. Applying the systems dynamics approach, a budget resource planning tool was developed using a linear programming optimization technique. This study illustrates that classic industrial uses of linear programming optimization techniques can uniquely be used to optimize budget resource planning for sustainable HBCU supply chain networks and other emerging research institutions. © 2017 American Society for Engineering Management.","Budget resource planning; HBCUs; Patent licensing; Social comparison theory; Technology commercialization; Theory of distribution management; University tech transfer","Budget control; Industrial research; Linear programming; Optical variables measurement; Resource allocation; Societies and institutions; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Teaching; Technology transfer; Distribution management; HBCUs; Patent licensing; Resource planning; Social comparison theory; Technology commercializations; University tech transfer; Engineering education",,"Hamilton, C.; Industrial and Systems Engineering, United States; email: clovia.hamilton@gmail.com","American Society for Engineering Management",,,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040036069

Various inventory management methods are typically employed for different types of products based on their demand patterns, product attributes, and supply network. In this paper, our goal is to develop robust demand prediction methods for weather sensitive products at retail stores. We employ historical datasets from Walmart, whose customers and markets are often exposed to extreme weather events which can have a huge impact on sales regarding the affected stores and products. We want to accurately predict the sales of 111 potentially weather-sensitive products around the time of major weather events at 45 of Walmart's retail locations in the U.S. Intuitively, we may expect an uptick in the sales of umbrellas before a big thunderstorm, but it is difficult for replenishment managers to predict the level of inventory needed to avoid being out-of-stock or overstock during and after that storm. While they rely on a variety of vendor tools to predict sales around extreme weather events, they mostly employ a time-consuming process that lacks a systematic measure of effectiveness. We employ all the methods critical to any analytics project and start with data exploration. Critical features are extracted from the raw historical dataset for demand forecasting accuracy and robustness. In particular, we employ Artificial Neural Network for forecasting demand for each product sold around the time of major weather events. Finally, we evaluate our model to evaluate their accuracy and robustness. © 2017 American Society for Engineering Management.","Artificial Neural Networks; Big Data; Inventory Management; Supply Chain","Big data; Costs; Forecasting; Inventory control; Neural networks; Retail stores; Sales; Supply chains; Weather forecasting; Weather information services; Critical features; Demand forecasting; Extreme weather events; Forecasting demand; Historical dataset; Inventory management; Measure of effectiveness; Product attributes; Supply chain management",,"Taghizadeh, E.; Wayne State UniversityUnited States; email: elham.taghizadeh@wayme.edu","American Society for Engineering Management",,,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040034323

In addition, the dynamic world in this complex supply chain system demands the manager to make faster and efficient decision. To manage the overall supply chain complexity and to make an efficient decision it is important that the manager understand the associated complex interactions within a supply chain, as well as, proper solution method to mitigate them.

In the proposed methodology, a timed Petri ne<t represents the railway network and the trains travelling over the rail lines; such a net also includes some places and some stochastically-timed transitions that are used to model the occurrence of unexpected events (accidents, disruptions, and so on) that make some resources of the network (tracks, blocks, crossovers, overhead line, electric power supply, etc.) temporarily unavailable. The overall Petri net is a live and bounded Generalized Stochastic Petri Net (GSPN) that can be analyzed by exploiting the steady-state probabilities of a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) that can be derived from the reachability graph of the GSPN.

It is one of the most promising ""next generation manufacturing systems"" or ""intelligent manufacturing systems"" The ""holons"" are specially design entities inside the manufacturing system, which are ""wholes"" and ""parts"" at the same time, and they have the ability to make their own choices under certain circumstances. Because of this double status of the holons, the HMS concept succeed to overcome the rigidity and slow reactions to disturbances of the classical hierarchical productions systems, maintaining at the same time the system's stability and reliability. Among the practical results we find, several reference architectures, communication protocols and large-scale industrial software applications. These computer supported collaborative decision making applications are already successfully applied in supply chain management and logistics, too. This way the holonic approach already exceeded the boundaries of a single enterprise. In the paper we will point out, that the concept might be useful also in non-industrial, non-Technical or technological context. In the paper we propose both theoretical and practical developments of the HMS concept. We mostly focus on upgrading the information systems management of businesses and public services.

In this paper, the actual state of the art in distributed manufacturing is presented. Afterwards, sustainability oriented reasons for a trend towards distributed manufacturing networks are explained. Then, evolutionary stages in the development of factories are represented describing their characteristics at every stage.

Many countries established strict rules to ensure the food traceability ""from farm to fork"" to meet the demand of consumer safety and to ensure public health. Consequently, the concepts of controlled supply chain, brand of quality and traceability of food products have had a strong evolution. Companies in the food production sector must evolve and change their organizational and management chain to satisfy increasingly stringent government rules and to respond to the requirements of the market. From this point of view, NFC (Near Field Communication) has all the requirements to become the main technology for traceability in the various food sectors. This paper proposes a solution to gather information throughout the entire food supply chain and bring it directly to the consumer. The architecture consists of a complex identification system based on NFC tags, which cumulates data during all phases of the production process. The aim of this work is to keep track of the information generated during food processing, not only for traceability purposes, but also for enhancing and optimizing production. The data generated by the traceability system are collected in a cloud database through apps on Android smartphones.

These uncommon spare parts occupy valuable space in smaller inventories and take a long time to be transported to the point of need, thus delaying the repair process. This paper proposes that storing the spare parts on a server and producing them with additive manufacturing (AM) on demand can shorten the repair cycle by simplifying the logistics. Introducing AM in the repair supply chain lowers the number of products that need to be reimbursed to the customer due to lengthy repairs, improves the repair statistics of the repair shops, and reduces the number of items that are held in stock. For this paper, the functionality of the concept was verified by reverse engineering a memory cover of a portable computer and laser sintering it from polyamide 12. The additively manufactured component fit well and the computer operated normally after the replacement. The current spare part supply chain model and models with AM machinery located at the repair shop, the centralized spare part provider, and the original equipment manufacturer were provided. The durations of the repair process in the models were compared by simulating two scenarios with the Monte Carlo method. As the biggest improvement, the model with the AM machine in the repair shop reduced the duration of the repair process from 14 days to three days. The result points to the conclusion that placing the machine as close to the need as possible is the best option, if there is enough demand. The spare parts currently compatible with AM are plastic components without strict surface roughness requirements, but more spare parts will become compatible with the development of AM. © 2017 The Authors.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; digital spare parts; Monte Carlo simulation; supply network","3D printers; Intelligent systems; Laser heating; Life cycle; Machinery; Manufacture; Microcomputers; Monte Carlo methods; Repair; Reverse engineering; Sintering; Supply chains; Surface roughness; 3-D printing; Central warehouse; Laser sintering; Original equipment manufacturers; Plastic components; Portable computers; Spare parts; Supply networks; Laser materials processing",,"Chekurov, S.; Aalto University, Otakaari 1, Finland; email: sergei.chekurov@aalto.fi","Elsevier B.V.",18753884,9781510848900,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037704165

Adapting to environmental protection and consumer requirements has compelled manufacturers and distributors to formulate forward and reverse logistics networks (RLNs) simultaneously. Moreover, the increasingly transparent contradiction between the supply and demand of resources coincides with the enterprises’ experience of growing cost pressures, for which recycling and remanufacturing gradually became important techniques to reduce the production cost. Under this background, the closed-loop logistics (CLL) has received significant attention from the academia and industry. In this chapter, we defined the related concepts with CLL; proposed the theoretical framework, including the CLL network structure and sustainable operations of logistics; and analyzed the effect of CLL on manufacturing, services, and people’s lives with a special focus on the main sustainable operations, namely, recycling and remanufacturing. The results revealed that implementing CLL management became a strategic choice for many enterprises, with its vital significance to decrease waste emissions, protect the environment, reduce production costs, improve economic efficiency, enhance competitiveness, promote enterprise technology innovation, and strengthen environmental protection. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Closed-loop logistics chains; Economic performance; Environmental protection; Reversed logistics; Waste emission",,,"Liu, B.Y.; School of Economics and Management, China; email: jasperseu@fzu.edu.cn","Springer International Publishing",19316828,,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037672947

To enable transformation of the industry, innovations are needed to develop value-added products and to shift to an efficient integrated value chain. In this regard, improved logistics for better handling of raw material, forest biomass utilization, and use of new technologies are some promising avenues. In this paper, we propose a generic value chain model that includes locating new sorting yards and biorefineries maximizing the overall profit of the value chain. This integrated planning problem deals with strategic decisions including investments in new facilities and technologies and tactical decisions comprising backhaul transportation and fibre flows across the value chain. To solve such a problem, we developed a mixed integer programming model to design the forest value chain network. This model is used in an industrial case study in the province of Newfoundland, Canada. We have generated and analyzed 32 scenarios evaluated on 12 predefined key performance indicators. The results show that collaboration through backhauling, common terminals, and new assortments are important opportunities to improve the profitability and efficiency of the value chain. The potential improvement over the current situation is as high as 23% considering the aforementioned actions. © 2017, Canadian Science Publishing.

The results of this study revealed that civil-military relations are essential for EPM to function as a coordinated approach to safety and security, and are necessary to respond effectively to complex emergencies and mitigating threats to developed countries. Civil-military relations are still a concern in the context of communication, the exercise of authority, and the coordination of emergency supplies (ES) to emergency operations. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study is based on field observations, with attention focused on the EPM of Sweden, Finland, and Poland. The analysis of a broader SCNM through EPM was supported by semi-structured interviews among civil-military actors in Sweden, information collected from informal conversations known as “hanging out”, and secondary materials. Empirically, the analysis included a variety of civil-military relationships and identified implications for management, policy, and planning that are applicable to developed countries. Findings: The management of civil-military relations is a meaningful resource when used as an overall approach for safety and security. The integration of civil-military relations in EPM in the planning of ES is a long-standing and complex matter. The management of Swedish civil-military relations in EPM is recognising that implications for management are imbedded in continuous policy changes in, for example, the Swedish policy history. Civil-military relational complications that arise in the field of operations are impossible to anticipate during emergency planning, as those complications are grounded in policy changes. Originality/value: Escalating threats to developed countries are highlighted. The study underlines the primary measures used in studying military involvement in EPM. An understanding of SCNM as a choice for management can be obtained in future research that focuses on a broader role of the military in EPM. Sweden has emphasised a clearer role for the military by reactivating total defence planning and by evolving common practices and processes with civil actors in civil defence. Meanwhile, Poland and Finland are increasing their focus on supporting the management of civil-military policies on safety and security regarding communication, authority, and developing coordination. Consistent with findings from previous reports on SCNM, civil-military relations are essential for EPM. This study confirmed the importance of civil-military coordination, the management and practice of authority, and shared forms of communication. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Changed threats; Civil-military coordination; Complex emergencies; Emergency preparedness management; Emergency supply; Supply chain network management",,,"Kaneberg, E.; Department of Business Administration, Sweden; email: Elvira.Kaneberg@ju.se","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20426747,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036661890

Different biomass conversion technologies are considered, such as pyrolysis and gasification and subsequent hydro processing and the Fischer-Tropsch process. A supply chain network approach is used for the modeling, which enables the optimization of both the biorefinery locations and the associated transportation networks. Gasification of corn stover is examined to convert waste biomass into valuable fuel. Biomass-derived fuel has several advantages over traditional fuels including substantial greenhouse gas reduction, generating higher quality synthetic fuels, providing a use for biomass waste, and potential for use without much change to existing infrastructure. The objective of this work is to show the feasibility of the use of corn stover as a biomass feedstock to a hydrocarbon biofuel supply chain in Ontario using a mixed-integer linear programming model while accounting for the uncertainty in the availability of corn stover. In the case study, the exact number of biorefineries is left as a policy decision and the optimization is carried out over a range of the possible numbers of facilities. The results obta ined from the case study suggests implementing gasification technology followed by Fischer-Tropsch at two different sites in Ontario.

A few exemplary supply chains have addressed these challenges through innovative offsite manufacturing (OSM) techniques. Despite its benefits, uptake of OSM in Australia remains limited. A fundamental challenge to OSM is the lack of collaboration across the deeply fragmented housing construction sector. While collaboration is critical in these settings, theoretical work on the topic remains limited. This paper's aim is to examine collaborative practice in innovative housing construction supply chains in Australia using an innovative methodology that supports actor-network theory with causal loop diagrams. Drawing on qualitative data from five OSM supply chains, elements that influence the creation stage of collaborative networks were identified, along with inter-relationships between them. Actor-network theory is applied to initially structure the identified elements into a tentative sequential process.

Over the past 2 decades, there have been major advances in understanding AF pathophysiology, but important knowledge gaps, particularly about targetable basic mechanisms, remain. Recent metabolomic and proteomic studies have shown changes in the expression of molecules involved in metabolic pathways in human and experimental AF, indicating a role for metabolic alterations in AF pathophysiology. AF is characterized by irregular high-frequency excitation and contraction that affect atrial energy demands, circulation and oxygen supply, and change the balance between metabolic demand and supply, causing metabolic stress. Here, we review the information available about AF-induced metabolic changes and their pathophysiological contribution. We also discuss the possibilities of developing novel therapeutic strategies that act by modulating cardiac metabolic processes during AF. © 2017, Japanese Circulation Society.

As the next generation of engineers who will take responsibility for advancing the sustainability of products, processes, and systems, engineering students need to become more familiar with the concepts of sustainable product design and manufacturing. Yet, educators are disadvantaged in training these students, and tools are deficient in assisting product sustainability assessments for manufacturing decision making by other non-experts.

The reasons for this problem include persistent vandalism of energy infrastructure, high cost of gridline network and weak transmission, and distribution facilities. Existing capacity only provides electricity to 34% and 10% of urban centres and rural areas, respectively. Decentralised renewable energy technologies (RETs) may be a sustainable and economical alternative for meeting electricity demands of the rural communities representing two-thirds of the total country’s population. This research thus investigates alternative RETs that may provide sustainable electricity to Nigerian rural areas. Interview method was used. The findings reveal that the most suitable RETs in order of priority are biomass, solar PV, small hydropower, solar thermal, and wind energy systems. In addition, biomass energy systems (BES) being the most selected, has been subjected to further investigation; unlike the national energy policy under representation of BES, 77% of the interviewees agreed that BES utilisation in the country’s rural areas are suitable and desirable. Also, for implementation of BES, all the identified drivers and enablers should be taken into consideration. However, some identified constraints to adoption and development of BES include supply chain limitation, substantial land, and water requirements for set-up and processing. Thus, this study recommends that the existing rural areas energy policies be reviewed. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Biomass energy system; Nigeria rural areas; Renewable energy technologies; Sustainable electricity","Biomass; Energy policy; Supply chains; Wind power; Biomass energy systems; Distribution facilities; Electricity demands; Electricity generation; Energy infrastructures; National energy policy; Nigeria; Renewable energy technologies; Rural areas",,"Garba, A.; The Scott Sutherland School, United Kingdom; email: hakeemgarba@gmail.com","Springer International Publishing",,9783319503462; 9783319503455,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034586459

The global commodity chain (GCC) research of Gereffi and Korzeniewicz (Commodity chains and global capitalism, 1994) stimulated the formulation of related but distinct frameworks (global value chains/GVCs and global production networks/GPNs) to understand the ways in which manufacturing and services are integrated while being geographically dispersed. Taylor (Offshoring and working conditions in remote work, 2010a) applied these GVC and GPN frameworks to the call/contact centre chain which entwined the sites of “remote” service delivery in India with the location of corporate decisionmaking and final customers in the home countries of the USA, the UK, and elsewhere. This chapter, developing these insights, utilizes the GVC and GPN frameworks to undertake an empirical study that examines work and employment in Indian business process outsourcing (BPO) industry post-recession. The study addresses the lacuna of published work on post-crisis Indian BPO by examining the dynamics of work and employment in three contrasting servicing chain relationships that span the spectrum of offshoring in the Indian BPO industry-an Indian third-party organization, a global service provider and a captive (i.e. in-house) operation.

A critical synthesis of the academic and practice literature is used to identify, conceptualise, analyse and categorise PSC models. From a theoretical perspective, a systems view of operations research is adopted to provide insights on a broader range of OR activities, from conceptual to mathematical modelling and model solving, up to implementation. The research demonstrates that: 1) current definitions of the PSC are largely production-centric and fail to capture patient consumption, and hence healthcare outcomes; 2) most PSC mathematical models lack adequate conceptualisation of the structure and behaviour of the supply chain, and the boundary conditions that need to be considered for a given problem; 3) models do not adequately specify current unit operations or future production technology options, and are therefore unable to address the critical questions around alternative product or process technologies; 4) economic evaluations are limited to direct costing, rather than systemic approaches such as supply chain costing and total cost of ownership. While current models of the PSC may help with the optimisation of specific unit operations, their theoretical benefits could be offset by the dynamics of complex upstream (supply) and downstream (distribution and healthcare delivery) systems. To overcome these limitations, this research provides initial directions towards an integrated systems approach to PSC modelling. This perspective involves problem conceptualisation and boundary definition; design, formulation and solution of mathematical models, through to practical implementation of identified solutions. For both academics and practitioners, research findings suggest a systems approach to PSC modelling can provide improved conceptualisation and evaluation of alternative technologies, and supply network configuration options. © 2017 The Authors","Critical interpretative synthesis; Modelling; Pharmaceuticals; Supply networks",,"35708-233529; EPSRC: EP/M017559/1, EP/P006965/1","Settanni, E.; Institute for Manufacturing, 17 Charles Babbage Road, United Kingdom; email: E.Settanni@eng.cam.ac.uk","Elsevier Ltd",22147160,,,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034052362

The scheduling problem for oil products supply chain is very complicated because of numerous constraints to be considered. The published literatures on schedule optimization of oil products pipeline network usually focus on the batch plans of each pipeline, without consideration on the receipt and delivery schedule of transfer tank farm. In this paper, a mixed-integer linear programming(MILP) model is developed for the schedule optimization of transfer tank farm. The objective of the model is to minimize switching times of the tank operations of a tank farm during a planning horizon, while fulfilling the products transmission requirements of the upstream and downstream pipelines of the tank farm. The constraints of the model include material balance, the operational rules of tanks, the topological structure constraints of the tank farm, the settling period of the oil products stored in dedicated tank and so on. To satisfy the constraint of fulfilling the specific transmission requirements of pipelines, concepts of static and dynamic time slot are proposed. A continuous time representation is used to obtain accurate optimal schedules and decrease scale of the model by reducing the number of variables. The model is solved by CPLEX solver for a transfer tank farm of an oil products pipeline network in China. Some examples are tested under different scenarios and the results show that global optimal solution can be obtain at acceptable computational costs. © Copyright 2017 ASME.",,"Continuous time systems; Integer programming; Oil tanks; Pipelines; Pressure vessels; Steel tanks; Supply chains; Topology; Computational costs; Continuous-time representation; Delivery schedules; Global optimal solutions; Mixed integer linear programming model; Schedule optimizations; Scheduling problem; Topological structure; Tanks (containers)",,"Wu, C.; Petroleum Storage and Transportation Engineering, China; email: wucc@cup.edu.cn","American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)",0277027X,9780791858028,APVPD,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034020139

Previous studies have examined the relationships between supplier management-related variables and market performance with cross-sectional data; however, little guidance is available for newly internationalizing ventures aiming to build a global supply chain network from scratch. To shed light on this dynamic process, we examine Uniqlo's successful supply chain development in China, using longitudinal contextual data. Our findings show that Uniqlo went through discrete dynamic stages in its supply chain development efforts. First, Uniqlo, initially a small firm, developed relational governance with its suppliers by exercising dynamic economic power concentration over time. Second, it began to provide technical support to help its suppliers build competence with the aim of increasing their cooperation. Third, Uniqlo enforced compulsory nonexclusivity arrangements with suppliers to achieve supplier flexibility by not just having Uniqlo as primary customer. This provides relational flexibility through both relational governance and partner flexibility for the principal firm in the global supply chain development. ©2017, American Marketing Association.","China; Dynamic proccss; Global market; Internationalization; Japanese management; Relational flexibility; Supply chain",,"JSPS: 15K03685","Kotabe, M.; International Business and Marketing, United States; email: mkotabe@temple.edu","American Marketing Association",1069031X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033232671

This study aims to propose three different strategies according to the combination of purchasing structure and vendor managed inventory (VMI) with targeting to reduce lead time and cost. The discrete event simulation (DES) is a powerful tool used to reveal the supply chain performances. The three strategies result in shorter lead time and cost reduction.

Supply chain planning under uncertainty is a challenge for decision makers. Without considering uncertainties in supply chain planning, global supply chains may suffer enormous economic costs. When probability distributions for uncertain parameters can be estimated, stochastic programming can be used for capturing the characteristics of uncertainties and generating flexible production and transportation plans for global supply chains. This paper presents an outline on how to use stochastic programming for decision support under uncertainty. This includes a high level exposition of how to quantify uncertainties, develop stochastic programming models, generate representative scenarios, apply algorithms for model solving, undertake experimental design and present computational results.

Such behavior exists in biological systems, physical systems as well as in the human performance. It is an inherited nature of a System-of-Systems (SoS). A suitable framework is needed to guide the development of SoS architecture, which includes emergent behavior. Enterprise architecture (EA) is a discipline driving change within organizations. Aligning and integrating business and IT thereby belongs to strategic management. The management of EA change is a challenging task for enterprise architects, due to complex dependencies amongst EA models, when evolving towards different alternatives. In this paper, various architecture frameworks are explored for an application on SoS architecture. The use of Zachman Framework to guide the architecture development is described in step-by-step details in this paper. The agent-based simulation is recommended to develop the SoS architectural models following the Zachman Framework guidance. Ultimately, SysML and UML should be integrated with the agent-based model.

The tool is demonstrated on a sample of three foods (milk, chicken and fish) in India, which historically has suffered significant interruptions. The effect of interruptions is quantified in terms of tonnage and monetary value of potential losses, in a number of simple scenarios. These losses are estimated for rural and urban areas of each Indian state. Our model indicates that extensions to the duration of power supply interruptions increases potential losses in domestic refrigerators, and that these losses are considerable when compared to losses expected in previous stages of the food supply chain. The current model's estimation of weight of food lost may be converted to a nutritional value, which opens an opportunity for new multidisciplinary areas of research. © 2017 The Authors.

The spatially distributed development of printed components, e.g. for the rapid delivery of spare parts, creates a new challenge when differentiating between ""original part"", ""copy"" or ""counterfeit"" becomes necessary. This is especially true for safety-critical products. Based on these changes classic branded products adopt the characteristics of licensing models as we know them in the areas of software and digital media.

This paper is particularly concerned with the role of infrastructure failure causing or exacerbating such cascading effects in supply chain networks. To improve the understanding of infrastructure and supply chain interdependency, we propose a novel modelling approach that captures the dynamics of both asset operability and network flows. The method uses a Markov process to generate operability scenarios and a multistage stochastic linear program to assign dynamic flows and optimise network capacities. The model takes into account different mechanisms of cascading failure, namely failure propagation, delay of recovery and unavailability of production inputs. A numeric example demonstrates how the method can be used to assess and optimises the resilience of a global supply chain against multiple hazards and infrastructure failure. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Interdependency; Network flow modelling; Supply chain resilience","Linear programming; Markov processes; Stochastic systems; Different mechanisms; Dynamic network flow; Infrastructure failures; Integrated supply chain networks; Interdependency; Interdependent infrastructures; Network flows; Supply chain resiliences; Supply chains",,"Goldbeck, N.; Centre for Transport Studies (CTS), United Kingdom; email: n.goldbeck14@imperial.ac.uk","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319684956,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032863881

Nevertheless, the loss of perishable goods is still high due to the deteriorating nature and inefficiencies in supply chains.

With temperature controlled reefer containers and sensor technologies, bananas can be monitored during transport and situations like early ripening can be predicted. In order to minimize spoilage, we propose a mathematical model for scheduling logistics activities with the consideration of both the biological process and the logistics procedure of bananas.

However, the existing literature discussed little on the non-linear behavior of the supply chain systems under chaos environment with disruptions. To fill the gaps, this paper aims to propose a more general formulation based on the coupled map lattices model for SCRES. The proposed model considers a multi-coupling and multi-level supply chain network. We use partial differential equations to form the coupled map lattices (CML) to model the behavior of non-linear network systems from perspectives of space and time dimension under different disruptions. Based on the simulation of two proposed indicators (Invulnerability and Restoration ability), we deduce four principles supporting to design SCRES; Finally, to further verify the feasibility of principles, we conduct a practical analysis as the comparison between our achievement and previous researches. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.","Coupled map lattices; Networks; Non-linear behavior; Resilience; Supply chains systems","Chains; Crystal lattices; Networks (circuits); Coupled map lattices; Infrastructure networks; Multi couplings; Nonlinear behavior; Resilience; Space and time; Supply chain network; Supply chain systems; Supply chains",,"Xu, Y.; Business School, China; email: ie.gordon.yu@gmail.com","IOS Press",18724981,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032830797

Design/methodology/approach - DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP) questionnaire survey with a theoretical SSCM model is applied to conduct an empirical test for the coal production and supply chain companies in Indonesia. Findings -The ""performance"" dimension out of the A-I-P of the SSCM is the most important one, while the ""adoption"" dimension is the least. Out of the 12 criteria under the three dimensions, the ""operational, economic, environmental, and social"" factors under the category of the performance dimension and the ""ISO 14001 certification"" criteria belonging to the dimension of ""implementation"" are the top five key factors in the SSCM. Research limitations/implications -There are some limitations in this study. First and foremost is the relatively small sample size with a limited geographic area, although they are unavoidable owing to one country case study. Practical implications -The test results are helpful to draw guidance for sustainable supply chain managers in implementing efficient SSCM in the wave of tough competition and changing marketplace. Originality/value -This study contributes first to developing a theoretical framework for SSCM under the A-I-P model and second, to applying DANP to an empirical case of SSCM of the coal industry in Indonesia. As a result, the authors draw helpful guidelines and policy implications for SSCM of the coal industry, referring to the A-I-P dimension as drivers and enablers for the SSCM performances of the industry. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Analytic network process (ANP); Asia; Critical success factors; DEMATEL; Sustainable supply chain management",,"NSC; MOST: NSC102-2632-H-031-001-MY3; MICYT; ","Wu, J.-Z.; Department of Business Administration, Taiwan; email: jzwu@scu.edu.tw","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09574093,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032678970

The location-allocation problem of facilities needs also to be resolved in conjunction with the quantity flow of Halal meat products from farms to abattoirs and from abattoirs to retailers. Design/methodology/approach - First, a deterministic multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model was developed and used for optimizing the proposed RFID-based HMSC network toward a comprised solution based on four conflicting objectives as described above. Second, a stochastic programming model was developed and used for examining the impact on the number of Halal meat products by altering the value of integrity percentage. The ε-constraint approach and the modified weighted sum approach were proposed for acquisition of non-inferior solutions obtained from the developed models. Furthermore, the Max-Min approach was used for selecting the best solution among them. Findings - The research outcome shows the applicability of the developed models using a real case study. Based on the computational results, a reasonable ROI can be achievable by implementing RFID into the HMSC network. Research limitations/implications - This work addresses interesting avenues for further research on exploring the HMSC network design under different types of uncertainties and transportation means. Also, environmentalism has been becoming increasingly a significant global problem in the present century. Thus, the presented model could be extended to include the environmental aspects as an objective function. Practical implications - The model can be utilized for food supply chain designers. Also, it could be applied to realistic problems in the field of supply chain management. Originality/value - Although there were a few studies focusing on the configuration of a number of HMSC networks, this area is overlooked by researchers.

Grocery stores sprout to supply the needs of megacities' population. Third party logistics (3PL) providers handle the supply chain aspects of stores so that stores can focus on their retailing competencies. The retailers often desire having a single point of accountability, hence fourth party logistics provider (4PL) is entrusted to manage activities of 3PL. However, 4PL in the long term has the tendency to collude with 3PL and misuse its status. This is possible due to the information asymmetry between logistics providers and retailers. In order to combat information asymmetry, a peer-to-peer audit system is necessary since it enforces price rationalization. Logistics providers are given access to the transaction data, which is ripe for analysis, as an incentive. We see blockchain as an appropriate tool to support the search and negotiation phase of a logistics contract. In this paper, we detail the data architecture and incentive structure for the proposed decentralized retailer-logistics provider ledger. Finally, we provide a sample execution to demonstrate how blockchain may be implemented in logistics contracting.","Blockchain; Data analytics; Logistics","Engineers; Logistics; Peer to peer networks; Sales; Supply chains; Block-chain; Data analytics; Data architectures; Fourth party logistics; Incentive structure; Information asymmetry; Logistics providers; Third-party logistics (3PL) providers; Outsourcing",,,"Institute of Industrial Engineers",,9780983762461,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031047933

In this paper, we study the optimal ordering policies in a multi-stage supply chain network subject to transportation disruptions and unreliable suppliers. The network includes a single retailer, a single warehouse, and two external suppliers with different levels of supply reliability. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is used to model the network. Using the model, two sourcing strategies at the warehouse are tested and compared, in terms of average cost per day. The first strategy is to order from a primary supplier with low reliability and low cost, and to order from a secondary reliable supplier at higher cost when the primary supplier fails to deliver the order. The second strategy is to divide the ordered quantity between the two suppliers having different reliability levels. A sensitivity analysis is conducted on multiple input parameters of the studied network. The results show that the second sourcing strategy enhances the performance of the studied supply chain in terms of minimizing average cost per day and shortage rates.","Simulation modeling; Supply chain risks; Supply reliability","Computer simulation; Costs; Engineers; Reliability; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Warehouses; Optimal ordering policy; Sourcing strategies; Supplier reliability; Supply chain network; Supply chain risk; Supply reliability; Supply-chain disruptions; Transportation disruptions; Discrete event simulation",,,"Institute of Industrial Engineers",,9780983762461,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031010825

However, assembly supply chains are particularly vulnerable due to manufacturers' dependence on upstream suppliers to provide materials and continue the flow of production. Cascading failures occur when an upstream supplier is disturbed and the negative production influence is percolated through the network. Traditionally, cascading failure models have been used to describe infrastructure networks. Recent studies have begun to document the impact of cascading failure in supply chain networks. This research provides a new model which takes the point of view of the downstream supplier inheriting production reduction from failed nodes upstream in the system. To help dampen the spread of failure, this model considers node fitness and redundancies in the supply chain network. The result of this research is a more realistic model which may be used in managerial decision making.","Cascading failure; Robustness; Supply chain networks","Decision making; Engineers; Robustness (control systems); Cascading failure models; Cascading failures; Financial impacts; Infrastructure networks; Managerial decision making; Production reduction; Supply chain network; Supply-chain disruptions; Supply chains",,,"Institute of Industrial Engineers",,9780983762461,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030993734

These organizations need to utilize innovative technologies to reduce costs and help achieve a lower-emissions environment. The industry involves a global supply-chain that is comprised of domestic and international transportation, inventory control, materials handling, import/export facilitation and information technology. Currently, the industry offers a classic model for executing supply-chain management techniques. However, companies can optimize their supply chains to generate more productivity for better financial returns. Applying some of the new techniques can diminish costs and reduce the uncertainty in the supply chain. The demand for digital oil-field attentions will grow once there is a reduction in oil costs. To improve supply chain management, it is necessary to use an optimization model. The objective of this paper is to review the various supply-chain techniques found within the oil and gas industry today, and offer an innovative solution of applying a linear programming model to optimize the transportation network of the supply chain. The model used in this study accounts for main cost components, as well the pumping and refinery costs. Optimization modeling is used to understand key factors needed to bring innovations to supply-chain management.","Logistics; Oil and gas; Optimization; Supply chain management","Cost reduction; Costs; Engineers; Gas industry; Inventory control; Linear programming; Logistics; Materials handling; Oil fields; Optimization; Petroleum transportation; Transportation; Innovative solutions; Innovative technology; Linear programming models; Oil and gas; Oil and Gas Industry; Optimization modeling; Supply chain innovations; Transportation network; Supply chain management",,,"Institute of Industrial Engineers",,9780983762461,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030986623

Supply chains may be fragile when sudden business environment fluctuations occur. Various quantitative analysis models are built to understand and mitigate supply chain risks. Dynamic Flow Bayesian Networks (DFBNs) are created by integrating Dynamic Bayesian Networks and System Dynamics to demonstrate the feedback flows of a supply chain with stochastic risks considered. However, it has limited ability in suggesting straightforward solutions for mitigating the risks. An Optimized Dynamic Flow Bayesian Network (ODFBN) incorporates mathematical optimization with the original DFBN. An ODFBN is a tool that offers business performance improvement strategies for supply chains by establishing objectives of a supply chain and constraints on the flows. Optimization-enhanced risk-influenced dynamic flow variables provide supply chain practitioners with a more effective reference for their business strategy. This paper presents an application of the ODFBN for a two-stage supply chain. Comparison between the ODFBN and the DFBN is illustrated with a discussion of preliminary modeling results.","Dynamic Bayesian Network; Hybrid model; Mathematical optimization; Supply chain risk analysis; System Dynamics","Engineers; Optimization; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risks; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; System theory; Dynamic Bayesian networks; Hybrid model; Mathematical optimizations; Supply chain risk; System Dynamics; Bayesian networks",,,"Institute of Industrial Engineers",,9780983762461,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030983157

Collaboration among enterprises has become an attractive strategy for market adaptation due to the recent development of information and communication technologies. This research investigates the effect of perishable inventory on collaboration, and proposes a strategy to manage the tradeoff between shortage and waste. A fundamental question that arises when designing a perishable inventory sharing strategy is that at which point of a product's lifetime the enterprise should share. To address this question, a collaboration strategy is proposed to find efficient decisions that minimize waste, shortage, and holding costs in the network, while maximizing the demand fulfillment rate. Experiments are conducted on several scenarios including different collaboration models (complete, partial, and no collaboration), network structures, and demand rates. The results indicate that complete collaboration, i.e., sharing the item regardless of its age, provides the highest benefits for the network, and increases each enterprise profit by 7% at least.","Collaborative networks; Perishable inventory management; Supply chain management","Engineers; Product design; Supply chain management; Attractive strategies; Collaboration models; Collaborative network; Coordination protocols; Demand fulfillments; Information and Communication Technologies; Perishable inventory; Perishable inventory management; Inventory control",,,"Institute of Industrial Engineers",,9780983762461,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030973835

Currently, the appearance of new technologies such as IoT and Big Data Analysis leads to a new generation of more functional, but complex, traceability systems. Organisational models based on cooperation of multiple small/medium size agents, for example of small/family farming cooperatives, play an important role in high standard agricultural production and commercialization processes. These function as both social and economic networks, with high social and economic impact in the rural areas. We use the case of Almeria as an example of this model, analysing its cooperative model. We have studied the actual traceability systems in the Almeria model, taking account of the different networked agents and their interrelation. This study has two main parts: a) analysis of the net-chains that constitute the food supply chains and their different relationships, b) actual traceability. The next step studied how the net-chain model, including many diverse agents, may be applied to develop a new generation of traceability systems based of IoT and Big Data. This implies extending the special and functional scope of the actual systems and defining clear rules of exchange of the results of the Big Data Analysis, taking account of the adequate Privacy Rules. This work analyses the current organisation as a base for a new generation of traceability systems considered in the European project IoF2020 (Internet of the Food and Farm 2020). We have detected some parallels between Almeria’s model and certain areas in China, mainly in the areas of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Shandong. Another of the objectives of this work is to deepen the understanding of these similarities and analyze the possible adaptation of the results from Almeria to China. © 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Considering the current state of affairs, it is barely impossible to reduce emissions without relying on CO2 capture and sequestration technologies. In a situation where a large-scale infrastructure is yet to be developed, mathematical programming techniques can provide valuable tools to decision makers for optimising their choices. Here, a mixed integer linear programming framework for the strategic design and planning of a large European supply chain for carbon geological storage is presented. The European territory is discretised so as to allow for a spatially explicit definition of large emission clusters. As regards CO2 capture, post-combustion, oxy-fuel combustion and pre-combustion are considered as possible technological options, whereas both pipelines (inshore and offshore) and ships are taken into account as possible transport means. The overall network is economically optimised over a 20 years’ time horizon to provide the geographic location and scale of capture and sequestration sites as well as the most convenient transport means and routes. Different scenarios (capturing up to 70% of European CO2 emissions from large stationary sources) are analysed and commented on. Results demonstrate the good European potential for carbon sequestration and give some indications on the total cost for CO2 capture, transport and sequestration. Capture costs are found to be the major contribution to total cost, while transport and sequestration costs are never higher than 10% of the investment required to set in motion and operate the whole network. The overall costs for a European carbon capture, transport and storage supply chain were estimated in the range of 27–38 €/ton of CO2. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide capture and sequestration; CCS design; CO2 pipeline and ship transport; Mixed integer linear programming; Supply chain optimisation","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Decision making; Fuels; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Investments; Offshore oil well production; Offshore pipelines; Precombustion; Ships; Supply chains; Transportation routes; Carbon dioxide capture; Carbon sequestration; CO2 pipeline and ship transport; Economic optimisation; Large scale infrastructures; Mixed integer linear programming; Sequestration technology; Supply chain optimisation; Carbon capture; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; linear programing; maritime transportation; optimization; pipeline; supply chain management; Europe",,"Bezzo, F.; CAPE-Lab – Computer-Aided Process Engineering Laboratory, via Marzolo 9, Italy; email: fabrizio.bezzo@unipd.it","Elsevier Ltd",17505836,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030870162

One of such change is origin of omnichannel in supply chain which believes in not only satisfying customer’s needs but also delighting them. Implementation of omnichannel in practice comes with lots of challenges. These challenges are summarized as major research areas in omnichannel and being explored in this paper through literature. Further, distribution system in omnichannel demands flexibility in distribution which results in restructuring and reconfiguring the practices of traditional supply chain. For this purpose, a mathematical model has been developed under omni environment which provides the facility of flexible distribution for customers. This proposed model is bi-objective in nature which considers sustainability along with minimization of total supply chain cost. To check the feasibility of the proposed model, numerical illustrations have been carried out for two different scenarios. In first scenario, the proposed model is solved for single product and single time period while in second scenario similar conditions are considered for conventional Supply Chain Network (SCN) and is being compared with proposed model. The proposed MILP model is coded in GAMS and solved using CPLEX solver. The results obtained indicate that proposed model possess superiority over conventional SCN in many aspects. The findings from the proposed model ensure that customers are free to avail product and services from their desired channel as per their choice. © 2017 The Author(s).

This cyber-physical system allows the smart factory to operate autonomously. For instance, a machine will know the manufacturing process that needs to be applied to a product, what variation to be made to that product etc., so that the product can be uniquely identifiable as an active entity whose configuration and route in the production line is unique.

However, in some countries where they rely heavily on the non-renewable fossil fuels as energy source, government subsidies and dropping oil prices have made biogas a less favourable option to the market. This paper reviews successful biogas implementation as a source of energy with effective government policy support. It is concluded that integrated planning and effective policy enforcement among the government departments are the major factor to the success. The government departments included those that have direct influence on the supply and demand chain of biogas. For example, the energy department, transport department, agricultural department, waste management department, science and technology department and finance department. Economic incentives are one of the policy tools that is frequently used. Besides, strategic collaborations and strong network between the like-minded countries is also the driving factor to the success.

In the first step we proposed a single-objective model to minimise the total costs consist of inventory related costs (purchasing, inventory replenishment, holding and shortage (backordering) costs), transportation costs (fixed and variable costs) and fixed establishment costs. In the second stage we used de novo programming to determine the optimal capacity of selected supplier(s). Therefore, we consider a second objective function to minimise the total costs related to capacity of selected supplier(s) (variable establishment cost).

It is very efficient in handling problems with high combinatorial complexity and has shown great superiority in reducing the related computational burden. Over the years, it has proven its efficiency in solving topologically and combinatorically challenging problems. Many successful applications to scientific and real-life problems have been produced, demonstrating the benefit potential. The application areas range from the initial chemical process synthesis to identifying the mechanisms of chemical and biochemical reactions, supply chains optimisation, regional resource planning, crisis management, evacuation planning and business process modelling. There have been tools of several generations implementing the P-graph framework, with a simple user interface, but featuring serious data input requirement. The P-graph framework also allows sensitivity analysis and produces usually a set of recommended solutions as opposed to the usual single output from straight applications of MP. The current contribution makes a critical overview of the achievements from applying the P-graph framework and the main issues to be dealt with. Based on that, a set of recommendations is made on the necessary future development of the implementations regarding modelling capability, data and algorithmic interfaces, representation of the modelled networks, as well as complexity management.

Reuse and recycling is a preferred option as much as it is applicable. A new strategy is proposed and analysed compared to the current state. Presently the waste treatment is a key information for effectivity assessment of a newly designed system. The known parameters are usually: production (sources) and processing (sinks) of given combustible waste in specific territory unit (node) from considered area and transportation between these nodes. For real life data analysis, available information is production and different ways of treatment (according to the waste hierarchy). Transportation between the nodes is not always evident, which can lead to a lack of knowledge of the total cost and expenses for individual producers. To gather information, it is necessary to obtain and assess available data. This research presents a tool for pre-processed data where the potential for combustible waste suitable for energy recovery and/or recycling in pre-defined nodes is determined. The tool is based on the reverse logistic problem, which is a specific case of supply chain model. The objective is to optimise the system of network flow of unusable products from the producer to the treatment facility. It describes an approach to determine the flow of the network with the utilisation of uncertainties, arising from incomplete or unknown information. Decision-making is done in relation to transportation distance criterion. This criterion naturally prefers closer treatment facilities instead of more distant. In order to reflect the uncertainty in the decision-making process, a probability function that links preferences for the particular type of waste is implemented. Developed mathematical model gives an estimation of mean value for a decision variable (potential for energy recovery) and also provides additional information about variability for each node. As a result of this analysis, an assessment creates a distribution function for the amount of waste for specific processing in particular node. The potential for energy recovery depends on the amount of combustible waste, which is currently landfilled and not used for recycling. These data outputs are further used for prognosis and form the necessary foundation for the planning of future treatment facilities. This tool has been tested through a case study involving the particular stream of combustible waste (network with 206 nodes). It has been found that it is suitable for various applications. The results of the optimisation can also provide a guidance for GHG (greenhouse gas) footprint reduction. However, any commodity, which is included in supply chain models can be handled in a similar way. In further research, possible extensions for the presented tool are additional criterions, i.e. more specific transportation cost, waste treatment cost criterion or influence from stakeholders in decision-making.",,"Computer system recovery; Costs; Decision making; Distribution functions; Greenhouse gases; Recovery; Recycling; Supply chains; Waste management; Decision making process; Probability functions; Reuse and recycling; Supply chain modeling; Supply chain models; Transportation cost; Transportation distance; Waste transportation; Waste treatment",,"Šomplák, R.; Sustainable Process Integration Laboratory - SPIL, Technická 2896/2, Czech Republic; email: Radovan.Somplak@vutbr.cz","Italian Association of Chemical Engineering - AIDIC",22839216,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030771880

The supply chain synthesis problem has been extended with recent development of biomass network and sustainability index. Optimisation is no longer sufficient to improve the biomass utilisation. A thorough knowledge of the biomass network is required to identify several bottlenecks that have been hampering the development of the biomass industry. After the identification of the bottlenecks, creative and innovative ideas are needed to suggest debottlenecking approaches by integrating the sustainability index into the biomass network. The integration of sustainability index into the biomass network for debottlenecking is a novel approach in this research paper.

The Voronoi diagram is a partitioning of a plane into regions (cells) based on distances to points (seeds) in a specific subset of the plane. Each point located within a given cell of the diagram lies closer to the seed located in this cell than to any other seeds in the network. In the geographical literature, these are also often referred to as Thiessen polygons. The objective set was accomplished by analysing the distribution and accessibility of discount stores of the Biedronka retail chain in the Polish city of Poznań. As of 30 June 2015, there were 61 Biedronka discount stores there, making this chain the city’s largest. The Voronoi diagram was used as a spatial frame of reference facilitating analysis of the distribution of these discount stores across the city. However, in-depth statistical study was conducted using indexing methods that estimate the level of accessibility, as well as indicators of spatial autocorrelation. This allowed for the identification of spatial patterns to the distribution of attributes examined. Taking into account two basic dimensions to the accessibility of services, i.e. proximity (a relationship between the distributions of supply and demand) and availability (a relationship between the volume and type of services offered and the volume and type of consumer needs), variables established for each cell of the diagram were: (1) average weighted distance from the place of residence to the nearest discount store and (2) the quotient of population size and store size (weight). These indicators provided for the determination of a synthetic index of accessibility, as the average of the values of the variables under study, which had previously undergone a standardisation procedure. The synthetic indicator showing the level of accessibility of discount stores in particular cells of the diagram was used to measure spatial autocorrelation. Analysis allowed for the identification of spatial regimes which made it easier to evaluate the distribution of discount stores and indicate new potential locations on the basis thereof. The results obtained showed that, notwithstanding the presence of a considerable number of Biedronka discount stores, mainly in the most densely-populated parts of the city, the accessibility of these discount stores across Poznań was diverse. The most favourable pattern for the spatial distribution of Biedronka discount stores as set against population distribution was identified in the central area of Poznań. In turn, a spatial regime characterised by a low level of accessibility was found to extend over large areas in the eastern part of the city. The research showed that application of the Voronoi diagram facilitates analysis of the distribution and accessibility of retail stores. The transformation of a set of points into a diagram with cells of a polygon type permits the identification of spatial relations and regularities used in estimating accessibility. It would be impossible to achieve this were point-type methods to be applied. The research discussed in this paper represents one of the few studies in Polish geographical or economic literature in which the spatial variability of social and economic phenomena is analysed to generate a Voronoi diagram. This situation stands in marked contrast to the vast body of foreign literature on this topic. This paper therefore helps bridge a substantial research gap in its field. © 2017, Polska Akademia Nauk.

In this paper, we discuss impacts of Industry 4.0 along the entire automotive supply chain. In particular, we illustrate that Industry 4.0 in the automotive context has a high cross-impact between development, production, operation and maintenance, thus requiring innovative solutions along the entire value creation chain. We enhance the commonly understood scope of Industry 4.0 towards digitalization over the entire product lifecycle and introduce data-driven business models to support exploitation of opportunities coming from this digitalization over the supply chain.

In the last decade, construction supply chain management (CSCM) has become a new challenge for construction managers in order to procure right quantities of materials to construction site on time, and within the pre-defined budget. Supplier selection as a significant process in SCM is a multi-criteria decision making problem. There is a broad literature on supplier selection that examines selection of supplier evaluation criteria and multi-criteria decision making methods. Individual and integrated multi-criteria decision approaches are studied by many researchers. In this paper, supplier selection analysis for wall, cladding and roofing construction materials are researched. Whilst literature review and expert panel are employed in order to identify criteria, weights of each criterion are determined by an extensive questionnaire survey. Participants are selected from the experts in construction industry, universities and governmental institutions. Analytic Network Process (ANP) is utilized as multi-criteria decision making methodology and weights of criteria are obtained. This study is a section of an on-going doctoral research, in other words, a part of a more comprehensive model. The study is significant due to the development of a new approach on construction material supplier selection and the basis of the model that is able to provide decision support for construction project participants throughout the project life cycle. © 2017 The Authors.","construction industry; construction material; CSCM; multi-criteria decision making; supplier selection","Budget control; Building materials; Construction industry; Decision making; Decision support systems; Life cycle; Roofs; Supply chain management; Surveys; Analytic network process; Construction supply chain management; CSCM; Multi criteria decision making; Multi-criteria decision making methods; Multi-criteria decision making problems; Supplier selection; Supply chain managements (SCM); Project management","1505F517","Cengiz, A.E.; Anadolu University, Turkey; email: aemrecengiz@gmail.com","Elsevier Ltd",18777058,,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030314607

The introduction of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in the fashion and apparel industry has led to massive data sets which are currently an untapped source for decision makers. We therefore aim to leverage the economic potential of RFID by proposing a framework for novel RFID-enabled indicators. We use the term Value-Added Indicators (VAIs), instead of the common acronym KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), because the proposed metrics aim to add additional value to the existing management reporting with regard to the fashion and apparel supply chain. Design, Methodology, Approach: We combine two sources of knowledge in order to build a comprehensive framework. We (i) use the theoretical background from a review of the relevant literature and (ii) use the experience from an RFID-system integrator and two fashion companies that have already deployed RFID on a large scale. The framework is then validated in several iterations by academics and practitioners. Findings: The study has produced a set of 60 different VAIs that use, or might use, RFID technology to produce, monitor and increase the overall value of the fashion and apparel supply chain. These VAIs are organised in a structured framework, built and validated by more than 10 experts from the field. The framework was then further validated by 24 experts, comprehending managers and researchers from outside the borders of the EU-Project SERAMIS. Practical Implications: Practitioners from the fashion and apparel industry benefit from our research by having available a validated framework with a set of 60 different VAIs that can be readily implemented into their own management reporting. The framework can thus serve as the foundation for building up an RFID-based measurement system or as a guideline for extending an existing measurement system. Originality/Value: We are the first who structure RFID-related performance indicators in a validated framework. Our framework can serve as a foundation for further research that goes beyond the fashion and apparel retail industry. We encourage researcher to build upon our research and to transfer it to different industries. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

The original Physarum model is modified to obtain the flux of each link under fuzzy link cost condition.

In Germany, the share of renewable energy in electricity production is believed to increase from 32.5% in 2015 to 50% in 2030. In order to operate an electrical system and control the mains frequency, the power supply must match the consumption at any time. Ancillary services like primary and secondary control are used to balance the system on a time-scale of several seconds up to 15 minutes. Those control reserves are usually provided by thermal power plants. Particularly in times of high shares of fluctuating renewable feed-in, thermal power plants are turned off or operated at minimum load to avoid electricity production at low electricity prices. However, an amount of about 3000 MW of fast responding primary control need to be provided in the European network of transmission system operators for electricity grid to maintain stable operation even in case of two simultaneous large unit outages. This requirement leads to situations, where thermal power plants are operated in minimum load below their marginal cost to provide control reserves even if there is a surplus of energy in the grid. Operation in low load while at the same time providing control reserves leads to new challenges. As the relation between energy production and the thermal storage capacities provided by the metal and fluid mass in the boiler is decreasing with the load, the ability of responding to control demands is naturally slowed down. Dynamic simulation of the thermodynamic power plant process turned out to be an efficient method to investigate such operational modes. Using comprehensive process models coupled with a control system model, equipment adaptions or control system updates can be evaluated in order to provide faster responses. By increasing the specific amount of ancillary services per unit, the number of units necessary to provide the total amount of primary and secondary control could be reduced in situations with energy surplus.

Fourteen Streckeisen STS-2 Broadband seismometers and two 3D sonic anemometers are deployed in/near an operating wind farm to collect the data used in these proof-of-principle analyses. The interquartile mean (IQM) value of power spectral density (PSD) of the seismic components in 10-minute time series are used to characterize the spectral signatures (i.e. frequencies with enhanced variance) in ground vibrations deriving from vibrations of wind turbine subassemblies. A power spectral envelope approach is taken in which the probability density function of seismic PSD is developed using seismic data collected under normal turbine operation. These power spectral envelopes clearly show the energy distribution of wind-turbine-induced ground vibrations over a wide frequency range. Singular PSD lying outside the power spectral envelopes can be easily identified, and are used herein along with SCADA data to diagnose the associated suboptimal turbine operating conditions. Illustrative examples are given herein for periods with yaw-misalignment and excess tower acceleration. It is additionally shown that there is a strong association between drivetrain acceleration and seismic spectral power in a frequency band of 2.5-12.5 Hz. The long-term goal of the research is development of seismic-based condition monitoring (SBCM) for wind turbines. The primary advantages of SBCM are that the approach is low-cost, non-invasive and versatile (i.e., one seismic sensor monitoring for multiple turbine subassemblies).

The purpose of fast valving is to maintain the stability of power system once fault or load shedding of unit occurs in the electric power system. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the reliability of fast valving for ultra-supercritical unit. In this paper, the KU ( short shedding) logic condition of SIEMENS T3000 system is analyzed as the research object of fast valving. The unit can be avoided over speed by monitoring the unit load and fast valving under faulty grid conditions based on the KU control. A series of measures will be taken after KU is triggered, for instance the governing valving will be closed quickly and the DEH (digital electro-hydraulic) control of the steam turbine will be switched to speeding control mode. On the other hand, the unit will return to normal operation if the transient fault of power grid disappears. The key contributions of this thesis include three parts: Firstly, based on the analysis of control characteristics of ultra-supercritical unit and protective logic and triggered conditions of KU function, a novel dynamic model by coupling the fast valving of steam turbine and the transient stability of generator is established by applying the PSCAD software. Then, the dynamic response process of ultra-supercritical unit is simulated and calculated by adopting the coupling dynamic model when KU function is triggered. Also the influence factors and reliability of fast valving are analyzed under transient fault conditions. Finally, two optimized measures by increasing the time delay and the speed of quantitative judgment are put forward to reduce risks and avoid the misoperation of signal distortion which may be caused by the power transmitter under transient fault conditions. The results of this study can not only help to evaluate the reliability of fast valving function scientifically in power grid transient fault, but also guide the technicians to analyze the stability of the power grid.

Its effective suppression is necessary to ensure safety and stability of the power system. The conventional power system stabilizer (PSS) is still insufficient in suppressing consider the frequency range and types of oscillation, so it is necessary to study the auxiliary suppression of the oscillation from the turbine side by using the electro-mechanical coupling theory. In this paper, a governorside power system stabilizer (GPSS) based on active power signal is designed, and its working principle, system structure and parameter setting method are introduced, the effective response frequency boundary of oscillation is also analyzed.

Consequently, it is extremely significant to predict flow-induced noise of centrifugal pumps under various working conditions with a practical mathematical model. In this paper, a three-layer back propagation (BP) neural network model is established and the number of input, hidden and output layer node is set as 3, 6 and 1, respectively. To be specific, the flow rate, rotational speed and medium temperature are chosen as input layer, and the corresponding flow-induced noise evaluated by average of total sound pressure level (A-TSPL) as output layer. Furthermore, the tansig function is used to act as transfer function between the input layer and hidden layer, and the purelin function is used between hidden layer and output layer. The trainlm function based on Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is selected as the training function. By using a large number of sample data, the training of the network model and prediction research are accomplished. The results indicate that good correlation is established among the sample data, and the predictive values show great consistence with simulation ones, of which the average relative error of A-TSPL in process of verification is 0.52%.

The uncertainties of supply-side (upstream) externalities (e.g., collection and logistics) represent the key challenges in bioenergy supply chains and lead to reduce cross-cutting sustainability benefits. We propose a mixed biomass-based energy supply chain (consisting of mixed-mode bio-refineries and mixed-pathway transportation) and a multi-criteria decision making framework to address the upstream challenges. Our developed framework supports decisions influencing the economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Economic analysis employs a support vector machine technique, to predict the pattern of uncertainty parameters, and a stochastic optimization model, to incorporate uncertainties into the model. The stochastic model minimizes the total annual cost of the proposed mixed supply chain network by using a genetic algorithm. Environmental impact analysis employs life cycle assessment to evaluate the global warming potential of the cost-effective supply chain network. Our presented approach is capable of enhancing sustainability benefits of bioenergy industry infrastructure. A case study for the Pacific Northwest is used to demonstrate the application of the methodology and to verify the models. The results indicate that mixed supply chains can improve sustainability performance over traditional supply infrastructures by reducing costs (up to 24%) and environmental impacts (up to 5%). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-oil; Biomass; Mobile bio-refinery; Supply chain; Sustainability; Uncertainty","Biomass; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decision making; Economic analysis; Environmental impact; Genetic algorithms; Global warming; Life cycle; Stochastic models; Supply chains; Support vector machines; Uncertainty analysis; Bio oil; Biorefineries; Environmental impact analysis; Environmental sustainability; Multi-criteria decision making frameworks; Stochastic optimization model; Support vector machine techniques; Uncertainty; Sustainable development; bioenergy; biofuel; biomass; decision making; environmental impact; global warming; life cycle analysis; optimization; supply chain management; support vector machine; sustainability; uncertainty analysis; Pacific Northwest",,"Mirkouei, A.Tingey Administration Building, Suite 310, University of Idaho, United States; email: amirkouei@uidaho.edu","Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029786041

To this end, not only were new retail concepts developed to broaden the distribution toward larger consumer bases, but alternative ways were also sought to reorganize supply networks for a balance between local and global production. Yet, the choice of supply network configurations must be coherent with a fashion companies’ critical success factors. Hence, it is pivotal to understand how such large brand portfolios and global supply networks could be effectively managed in a united way. In this vein, the purpose of this paper is to explain how the triplet of product, brand, and retail channel could affect SC performance, and how the positioning of a luxury company could depend on managerial attitudes. Design/methodology/approach: Subsequent to an extensive literature review, 30 most frequently quoted key performance indicators (KPIs) were derived. A Delphi study was then employed to reach a consensus and 17 key KPIs were derived considering the key SC performance areas and marketing dimensions. Survey technique was deployed to examine the impact of strategic combinations of product, brand, and retail channel on SC strategy. Survey results were analyzed through factor analysis where five principal components emerged to represent performance areas. ANOVA technique was then employed to explore the dependence between product-brand-retail channel and key performance areas. Findings: Brand, retail channel, and product directly affect operational performance. The positioning of a fashion company would depend on its management attitude toward strategy segmentation and considered stage of the SC. The respondents’ profile analysis further showed a preference to segment the SC based on products. Interestingly, this finding is not aligned with earlier research (Brun and Castelli, 2008) suggesting that the brand was to become the most relevant driver for SC segmentation. Originality/value: Academic development and empirical testing is rather rare in the luxury fashion context. Undeniably, SC strategies represent a very relevant issue for fashion companies, and the present study could be considered a first statistical step toward SC segmentation for luxury fashion companies. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand; Fashion industry; Product; Retail channel; Segmentation; Supply chain management",,,"Karaosman, H.; Department of Management, Politecnico di Milano, Italy; email: hakan.karaosman@polimi.it","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",13612026,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029720621

This fails to acknowledge the need for flexible operation of fossil CCS infrastructure in future low carbon energy systems, characterised by high shares of inflexible nuclear power and intermittent renewable power supply. In this environment CCS power stations are likely to be required to load-follow in order to balance the electricity grid. This results in extensive ramping and part-load operation as well as large variations in CO2 flows that are produced. Unless CO2 flow balancing techniques are deployed within the power stations, the CO2 transportation and storage (T&amp;S) systems will need to accommodate these large fluctuations in feed-flows. This paper addresses an identified gap in the literature by exploring the issues associated with flexible operation of CO2 T&amp;S systems, as well as options to overcome these issues. A particular focus is laid on the operational flexibility of injection wells as the potentially least flexible part of the system. © 2017 The Authors.","CCS; CO2 flow variability; CO2 transportation &amp; storage networks; flexible operation","Carbon dioxide; Electric power systems; Flexible structures; Greenhouse gases; Nuclear fuels; Wells; Flexible operation; Flow variability; Individual components; Low-carbon energy systems; Operating flexibility; Operational flexibility; Part load operation; Storage networks; Carbon capture","EPSRC: EP/K000446/1","Spitz, T.; Inst. for Ener.

For this purpose, a bi-level model was introduced to optimise the design of supply chain network and assembly line balancing. In this research supply chain network design problem is considered as a strategic decision in the upper-level model, while the lower-level model contains the assembly line balancing as a tactical decision. The three-level considered supply chain includes factories, assembly lines and customers. The factories produce the raw material needed for assembly lines to produce final products. The assembly lines produce final products and deliver them to customers to cover their demand. Also, these assembly lines balance their line simultaneously. The operation time for assembly line, the cost of operation and customer's demand were considered as uncertain variables.

The additional task of this problem is a warehouse network formation. The efficient location of warehouses is one of the priority objectives for cross-border regions as it allows them to benefit from membership in a global supply chain, promotes the creation of additional jobs and, finally, leads to the growth of Gross Regional Product (GRP). The authors offer an approach to determine the location of distribution centres and warehouses in the territory of the regions of the Russian Federation. This approach allows solving the problem of the efficient location of warehouse network in a region taking into account its key indicators of socioeconomic development. The implementation of the approach identified the indicators that have a significant impact on a choice of the location of warehouses of a region. Methodological framework of the conducted research includes the methods of ABC and cluster analyses. That provides the identification of the cities and municipal districts of a region, in the territory of which it is expedient to locate warehouses. The developed approach was tested on the example of the Volgograd region. The solution of the problem of warehouse network in this region belongs to the priority one, considering its geographical position and industrial capacity. The analysis of indicator values for the period of 2010-2014 by means of the methods of classical and modern ABC analysis as well as the two-stage cluster analysis allowed the territorial binding of the warehouse network in the Volgograd region. Further, the research showed that when splitting the cities and municipal districts of the region into clusters, the greatest influence is made by such indicators as investments into fixed capital, goods turnover of the motor transport and transportation of goods by the motor transport.","ABC analysis; Distribution centres and warehouses; Efficient location of warehouses; Key socio-economic indicators; Twostage cluster analysis",,"RHF: 16–12–34015","Popov, P.V.; Departments of Applied Mathematics and Informatics, 11, 40-let Pobedy St., Russian Federation; email: popov@vgi.volsu.ru","Institute of Economics, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences",20726414,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029547864

As a result of the attack, critical services to the supply chain are lost, and the manager has uncertain information regarding when these services will be available. We first consider a deterministic model where the supply chain manager has complete information about the restoration of damaged services. We extend this model to a stochastic programming model involving several different recovery scenarios. We present computational results for a realistic case study developed with an extensive literature survey. We compare results of the stochastic model with average deterministic results, and show that the average deterministic results do not produce good solutions for an uncertain setting. We conclude with general remarks on how supply chain managers should consider restoration decisions under uncertainty. © 2017 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).","Restoration; Stochastic programming; Supply chain networks","Computer crime; Crime; Decision making; Image reconstruction; Managers; Network security; Restoration; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Complete information; Computational results; Deterministic modeling; Literature survey; Oil supply chain; Stochastic programming model; Supply chain network; Uncertain informations; Stochastic models","NSF; ED",,"The Society for Modeling and Simulation International",07359276,9781510838284,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029491877

Furthermore, with increasing emphasis on vulnerabilities in supply chains, effective mathematical tools for analysing and understanding appropriate supply chain risk evaluation are now attracting more attention. Administration of a successful supply chain depends on how efficiently of the network design is measured and how source risks effect it. This research has two objectives. The first one is to design a multi agent supply chain network that addresses an uncertain environment threatened by different risk sources in order to capture the real world conditions; the second one is to present a methodology for estimating risk in the proposed network. Moreover tree of scenarios are constructed and risk assessment model considering domino effect is built in order to carry out the overall quantitative risk assessment. Then, probability theories are applied in the quantitative method. In conclusion, the key benefits and experience gained from this study and further research opportunity are emphasised.

The improvement of the performances and the consequent reduction of energy consumption lead to multiple extra benefits in addition to cost savings, for instance improved competitiveness, profitability and quality. For that reason, energy efficiency should be considered as a strategic advantage instead of a marginal issue. The relevance of this issue is particularly significant in energy intensive processes such as the metal industry (e.g. steel and aluminium producers), where usually high temperature processes present a remarkable opportunity to save energy through the excess heat recovery. The aim of the present work is to study a single-vendor single-buyer integrated production-inventory system with the opportunity to recover energy from the excess heat at the vendor production site. The chance to incur in larger savings thanks to a wider integrated network of heat exchanges across various actors along the supply chain (integrated heat recovery) is analysed. © 2017, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Energy efficiency; Heat recovery; Joint economic lot sizing; Supply chain","Costs; Energy utilization; Metal recovery; Supply chains; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; High temperature process; Integrated networks; Integrated production; Integrated supply chain model; Joint economic lot sizings; Manufacturing companies; Production sites; Strategic advantages; Energy efficiency",,"Marchi, B.; Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, via Branze, 38, Italy; email: b.marchi@unibs.it","Springer New York LLC",18684238,9783319669250,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029451577

Most studies have focused on areas such as: inter-/intra-organizational relationships, supply chain collaborations and networking capabilities. However, little attention has been paid by academia and practitioners to the concept of system designs that enable these intended functions. The research gap is quite evident in the case of energy efficiency, especially in multi-site manufacturing operations. This paper explores organizational models that can facilitate the development and sharing of best practice (DSBP) for energy efficiency and the conditions that enable these to be more effective vehicles of improvement. As part of a larger research project on practice maturity for eco-efficiency, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with industrial practitioners that are directly involved with energy efficiency improvements in two large multi-site organizations. The authors recognize two DSBP organizational models: (a) networks of practice (a decentralized approach) and (b) model-factories (more linear approach). This study aims to demonstrate the challenges and opportunities that each model brings and narrates the enabling conditions of their adoption. © 2017, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Best-practice sharing; Eco-efficiency; Maturity","Industrial management; Industrial research; Manufacture; Supply chains; Best practices; Eco-efficiency; Energy efficiency improvements; Industrial practitioners; Manufacturing operations; Maturity; Semi structured interviews; Supply chain collaboration; Energy efficiency",,"Litos, L.; Institute for Manufacturing, United Kingdom; email: ll443@cam.ac.uk","Springer New York LLC",18684238,9783319669250,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029410268

A coalition also incurs a cost for each arc that it uses to connect s and t, thus the coalition must choose a path of minimum cost among all the arcs that it controls. These games are relevant to logistics, communication, or supply-chain networks. We give a polynomial combinatorial algorithm to compute the nucleolus.

PLT shelf life can be extended to 7 days with an enhanced bacterial detection algorithm. Enhanced testing, however, comes at a cost, which may be offset by reductions in wastage due to longer shelf life. This article describes a method for estimating systemwide reductions in PLT outdates after PLT shelf life is extended. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A simulation was used to evaluate the impact of an extended PLT shelf life within a national blood network. A network model of the Canadian Blood Services PLT supply chain was built and validated. PLT shelf life was extended from 5 days to 6, 7, and 8 days and runs were completed to determine the impact on outdates. RESULTS: Results suggest that, in general, a 16.3% reduction in PLT wastage can be expected with each additional day that PLT shelf life is extended. Both suppliers and hospitals will experience fewer outdating units, but wastage will decrease at a faster rate at hospitals. No effect was seen by blood group, but there was some evidence that supplier site characteristics influences both the number of units wasted and the site's ability to benefit from extended-shelf-life PLTs. CONCLUSION: Extended-shelf-life PLTs will reduce wastage within a blood supply chain. At 7 days, an improvement of 38% reduction in wastage can be expected with outdates being equally distributed between suppliers and hospital customers. © 2017 AAB/1.",,"blood bank; blood group; circulation; human cell; shelf life; simulation; thrombocyte; blood storage; computer simulation; hospital management; human; microbiology; procedures; thrombocyte; time factor; Blood Platelets; Blood Preservation; Computer Simulation; Humans; Inventories, Hospital; Time Factors","CBS; NSERC","Blake, J.T.; Department of Industrial Engineering, Canada; email: john.blake@dal.ca","Blackwell Publishing Inc.",00411132,,TRANA,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028936136

However, the dual-channel (online/offline, forward/backward) operations of the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) changed the relationship between manufacturers and retailers, thus resulting in channel conflict. The purpose of this paper is to take a dual-channel operations of CLSC as the research target, where a manufacturer sells a single product through a direct e-channel as well as a conventional retail channel; the retailer are responsible for collecting used products in the reverse supply chain and the manufacturer are responsible for remanufacturing. Design/methodology/approach - The authors build a benchmark model of dual-channel price and service competition and take the return rate, which is considered to be related to the service level of the retailer, as the function of the service level to extend the model in the reverse SC. The authors then analyze the optimal pricing and service decision under centralization and decentralization, respectively. Finally, with the revenue-sharing factor, wholesale price and recycling price transfer payment coefficient as contract parameters, the paper also designs a revenue-sharing contract led by the manufacturer and explores in what situation the contract could realize the Pareto optimization of all players. Findings - In the baseline model, the results show that optimal price and service level correlate positively in centralization; however, the relation relies on consumers' price sensitivity in decentralization. In the extension model, the relationship between price and service level also relies on the relative value of increased service cost and remanufacturing saved cost. When the return rate correlates with the service level, a recycling transfer payment can elevate the service level and thus raise the return rate. Through analyzing the parameters in revenue-sharing contract, a point can be reached where lowering the wholesale price and raising the transfer payment coefficient will promote retailers to share revenue. Practical implications - Many enterprises establish the dual-channel distribution system both online and offline, which need to understand how to resolve their channel conflict. The conflict is especially strong in CLSC with remanufacturing. The result helps the node enterprises realize the coordination of the dual-channel CLSC. Originality/value - It takes into account the fact that there are two complementary relationships, such as online selling and offline delivery; used product recycling and remanufacturing. The authors optimize the strategy of product pricing and service level in order to solve channel conflict and double marginalization in the closed-loop dual-channel distribution network. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.","Closed-loop supply chain; Dual-channel; E-commerce; Pricing strategy; Revenue-sharing contract","Economics; Electronic commerce; Linear matrix inequalities; Manufacture; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Recycling; Sales; Supply chains; Centralization and decentralizations; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); Complementary relationship; Design/methodology/approach; Dual channel; Pricing strategy; Revenue sharing contracts; Costs","NSFC: 71272015, 71402053; NSSFC: 15ZDB161","Xie, J.; School of International Business Administration, China; email: jiaping@mail.shufe.edu.cn","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",02635577,,IMDSD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028773871

The modeling approach adopted aims at the embedding supply chain risks in a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network design process and suggests optimal supply chain configuration and risk mitigation strategies. Design/methodology/approach: The method proposes a closed-loop supply chain network and identifies the network parameter and variables required for closing the loop. Mixed-integer-linear-programming-based mathematical modeling approach is used to formulate the research problem. The solutions and test results are obtained from CPLEX solver. Findings: The outcomes of the proposed model were demonstrated through a case study conducted in an Indian hospital furniture manufacturing firm. The modern supply chain is mapped to make it closed loop, and potential risks in its supply chain are identified. The supply chain network of the firm is redesigned through embedding risk in the modeling process. It was found that companies can be in great profit if they follow closed-loop practices and simultaneously keep a check on risks as well. The cost of making the supply chain risk averse was found to be insignificant. Practical implications: Although the study was conducted in a practical case situation, the obtained results are not indiscriminate to the other circumstances. However, the approach followed and proposed methodology can be applied to many industries once a firm decides to redesign its supply chain for closing its loop or model under risks. Originality/value: By using the identified CLSC parameters and applying the proposed network design methodology, a firm can design/redesign their supply chain network to counter the risk and accordingly come up with planned mitigation strategies to achieve a certain degree of robustness. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Closed-Loop supply chain; Hospital furniture; Mixed-integer linear programming; Supply chain modelling; Supply chain network design; Supply chain risk",,,"Prakash, S.; Mechanical Engineering Department, India; email: suryayadav8383@gmail.com","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17465664,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028765804

Previous research showed significant differences between footwear supply networks that provide personalised products, especially regarding key variables, such as the level of demand uncertainty, type of productive capacity, type of purchasing and order dimensions. However no studies have considered these variables simultaneously, thus failing to provide a complete understanding. Moreover, previous studies on personalisation primarily focused on product features by identifying the different types of collections available without analysing implications for supply networks. To fill these gaps, we adopted a multiple case study methodology. Based on findings, we identified different personalisation types (individual personalisation, segmented personalisation, personalisation for distributor) and compared them to the case in which personalisation is not available. This work demonstrates that a company can develop and deliver different types of personalised collections, but this requires the management of different supply networks.

This is due to the utilisation of combustion processes of mainly fossil fuels to satisfy the heating demand of the building stock. Low temperature district heating (LTDH) can contribute significantly to a more efficient use of energy resources as well as better integration of renewable energy (e.g. geothermal or solar heat), and surplus heat (e.g. industrial waste heat) into the heating sector. LTDH offers prospects for both the demand side (community building structure) and the supply side (network properties or energy sources). Especially in connection with buildings that demand only low temperatures for space heating. The utilisation of lower temperatures reduces losses in pipelines and can increase the overall efficiency of the total energy chains used in district heating. To optimise the exergy efficiency of community supply systems the LowEx approach can be utilised, which entails matching the quality levels of energy supply and demand in order to optimise the utilisation of high-value resources, such as combustible fuels, and minimising energy losses and irreversible dissipation.

The time series modelling tools applied to the monthly demand forecasting of automobile spare parts in Mexico are assessed, for the case of a transnational enterprise, considering affordability. The classic methods of moving averages, final value and exponential smoothing, the prestigious autoregressive integrated models of moving averages (ARIMA), the rarely implemented artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the very little explored ARIMA-ANNs hybrid models are compared. A good performance of the models involving ANNs is observed, but they were not as steady as the ARIMA models in the post-sample periods. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was reduced from an original 57% to 32.65%.

The advent of cloud computing, its role as critical infrastructure and the requirement for trust between the users of computing resources combines to form a perfect environment for trusted and high-integrity computing. Indeed, the use of trusted computing is an enabling technology over nearly all ‘cyber’ areas: secure supply chain management, privacy and critical data protection, data sovereignty, cyber defense, legal etc. To achieve this, we must fundamentally redefine what we mean by trusted and high-integrity computing. We are required to go beyond boot-time trust and rethink notions of run-time trust, partial trust, how systems are constructed, the trust between management and operations, compute and storage infrastructure and the dynamic provisioning of services by external parties. While attestation technologies, so-called run-time trust and virtualized TPM are being brought to the fore, adopting these does not solve any of the fundamental problems of trust in the cloud. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Cloud; NFV; Security; Telecommunications; Trusted computing","Cloud computing; Clouds; Digital storage; Network security; Scheduling algorithms; Security of data; Supply chain management; Telecommunication; Computing resource; Dynamic provisioning; Enabling technologies; Secure supply chains; Security; Single- machines; Storage infrastructure; Trusted clouds; Trusted computing","","Oliver, I.; Security Research Group, Finland; email: ian.oliver@nokia-bell-labs.com","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319647005,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028464982

The risks cause disturbances in supply chain and hinder the movement of products across their stage which ultimately leads to overall increases in supply chain costs. In this paper, a multi-echelon closed-loop supply chain model is considered, where supplier's quality risks (production issues), logistics risks (transportation issues) are mathematically modelled using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. The paper highlights benefits of adopting the supply chain network design under risk. The comparison of risk and no risk situation is illustrated for a generic closed-loop supply chain network. The findings suggest that risk consideration in supply chain network design is very useful, and its cost is not much higher to the organisation too. The supply chain resilience can be achieved with a moderate risk premium. The firms which can pay 10-13% more will be able to sustain in risk events and their network configuration will be robust under supply and logistics risks happenings.

Research on the cause and characteristic of vulnerability is prerequisite for effective management measures. First, a supply chain network model based on Poisson distribution and preference selection mechanism is established, of which the interactions are further studied. On this basis, the cascading failure process of supply chain network i analysed, and then the impact of supply chain network topology on the system vulnerability and the determination of node vulnerability are further discussed. Finally, an example of certain automotive group supply chain is used to verify the effectiveness and practicality of this method. The study finds that the root of supply network vulnerability lies in cascading failure and there is a certain power-law relationship between its scale and frequency, namely supply chain network owns self-organised criticality, which affects the vulnerability of supply chain network.

This paper presents a method that builds attack graphs using data supplied from the maritime supply chain infrastructure. The method delivers all possible paths that can be exploited to gain access. Then, a recommendation system is utilized to make predictions about future attack steps within the network. We show that recommender systems can be used in cyber defense by predicting attacks.

By creating network models of infrastructure, resources and processes, it is possible to prioritize risks and identify critical vulnerabilities in processes, organizations and systems. Consequently, network models can be used to create effective plans for improving resilience. The main idea is to use a directed graph to construct a network risk model that can be used to identify the most effective options for improving resilience.

However, corporate sustainability is lacking with regard to development in practice, and the decision-making process is absent from a hierarchical structure that has complicated interdependent relationships among the attributes. However, the elimination of less important criteria from various measures and the criteria that are encountered remain with respect to both qualitative and quantitative measures. Thus, this study proposes to develop a corporate sustainability model for a focal firm in supply chain networks using the fuzzy Delphi method, interval-valued triangular fuzzy numbers and analytical network process method. The findings are as follows: the firm focused on the environmental operation design aspect, and it ranked five criteria, which included (1) decreasing the generation of toxic and hazardous matter; (2) environmental certificates; (3) service cycle processing time; (4) reducing the service costs, i.e., the service costs as a percentage of the revenue; and (5) the service output per hour/facility utilization. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the coordination of green design in operations and products, which indicated the corporate sustainable development criteria for the next frontier.

The proposed framework is green, in which it tackles the demand uncertainty of a product, environmental uncertainties, and the downstream risk attitude into the problem formulation. In this way, the demand uncertainty is taken into account through the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) method which, in turn, relies on the datadriven approach. On the other hand, uncertainty set approach is employed to deal with the environmental uncertainties, i.e. CO2 emissions. Proposition of such a green supply chain network, based on the aforementioned uncertainties, makes the proposed model realistic, which is what completely missing in the literature. In order to proceed with this model, a robust counterpart of the developed uncertain problem should be formulated. The augmented ϵ-constraint method is used to transform the developed multi-objective mathematical programming problem into a single-objective one. This may give rise to the global optimal solution through the exact mathematical solution method. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework. © 2017 Sharif University of Technology.

The more machines are interacting the higher will be the specific optimization potential. Navigation not only to the fields but also within the fields will certainly contribute to make use of these efficiency reserves. Necessary therefore is the knowledge of potential influences on infield-logistics to be able to navigate agricultural machinery in the fields effectively and process optimized. Preliminary studies based on GPS-lane analysis in different German agricultural regions and in Central Canada show that decisions on specific infield patterns to a certain degree depend on unchangeable factors such as field geometry or field access points. Nevertheless, regarding infield-logistics farm managers and staff members mostly act farm specifically as well as depending on technology or situation and furthermore often intuitive. The examination is based on expert interviews with farmers of all agricultural regions in Germany. Rural mixed farms with simple machinery are considered as well as large agricultural cooperatives which farm thousands of hectares using track guidance and other electronic assistance systems. By aerial images of their arable land the individual decision behavior should be analyzed to specify the “soft” influencing factors. First result shows that farm managers using guidance tracking or electronic assistance systems, such as Section Control, increasingly attune their infield-logistics to direction giving obstacles like power lines. Livestock farmers rather focus on the application of organic manure, where road networks, road conditions respectively and possible field access points become important due to the required supply logistics. Sugar beets make great demands on infield patterns because of relatively low bunker sizes compared to the mass to be transported as well as the positioning of the beet clamp. Afterwards the obtained influences can be integrated into a navigation tool for optimizing infield logistics. Thus process efficiency can be further increased. © 2017, Int.

It was implemented in the context of the National Insecticide Treated Nets (NATNETS) Programme and was the main keep up strategy for vulnerable populations. Case description The programme design was adjusted considerably over time to incorporate new evidence, shifting public health policies, and changing donor priorities. Three TNVS models can be distinguished: (1) the fixed discount; (2) the fixed top-up; (3) the hybrid voucher model. The changes improved equity and effectiveness, but also had a profound effect on how the programme was managed and implemented. Results The TNVS reached the majority of beneficiaries with vouchers, and significantly increased household ownership and use of LLINs. While two mass distribution campaigns implemented between 2009 and 2011 achieved universal coverage and equity, the TNVS ensured continuous protection of the vulnerable populations before, during and after the campaigns. The TNVS stimulated and maintained a large national retail network which managed the LLIN supply chain. Discussion and lessons learned The effectiveness of the TNVS was a function of several interdependent factors, including the supply chain of vouchers through the public health system; the supply chain of nets in the commercial sector; the demand for nets from voucher recipients; management and risk mitigation measures; and the influence of global and donor objectives. Conclusion The TNVS was a highly innovative and globally influential programme, which stimulated the thinking around effectively and equitably distributing ITNs, and contributed directly to the evolution of global policy. It was a fundamental component of the NATNETS programme which protected a malaria-vulnerable population for over a decade. © 2017, The Author(s).","Continuous distribution; Insecticide-treated nets; Keep up strategy; Long-lasting insecticidal nets; Malaria; Public private partnership; Tanzania; Vector control","economics; family size; female; financial management; human; infant; insecticide treated net; malaria; organization and management; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; preschool child; procedures; standards; statistics and numerical data; supply and distribution; Tanzania; utilization; Child, Preschool; Family Characteristics; Female; Humans; Infant; Insecticide-Treated Bednets; Malaria; Marketing of Health Services; Ownership; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Parasitic; Tanzania","","Kramer, K.; Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, P.O.

Physical Internet is a novel concept that transforms how physical objects are designed, manufactured and distributed aiming for a radical sustainability improvement. The implementation of the Physical Internet leads to the need to rethink some basic concepts of logistics such as the shift from private supply networks to open supply networks. Therefore, increased collaboration and coordination is necessary. In order to make a productive contribution to the first steps towards the Physical Internet in Austria, this article focuses on the need for horizontal collaborations, which are required to realize the Physical Internet. Moreover, the study explores the views, experiences, beliefs and motivations of transport service providers in Austria in the context of horizontal collaborations and the Physical Internet. A literature research was carried out in a first step. Afterwards interviews with forwarding agencies and logistics service providers were conducted. Findings highlight that barriers such as the fear of antitrust fines or the high administrative input have to be removed to enable close vertical and horizontal collaboration among different logistics companies in Europe, as the vision of the Physical Internet is encouraging a smooth transition from independent supply chains to open global supply networks. The implementation of a Physical Internet in its full expression could probably take decades, but individual elements of it, such as horizontal and vertical cooperation, are a first step towards this vision. Important components of the implementation process are awareness raising and information sharing. © 2017 WIT Press, www.witpress.com.","Horizontal collaboration; Logistics services; Physical Internet",,,,"WITPress",20588305,,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027588777

A comparative analysis is made to demonstrate the effectiveness of using microwave sensors over the other types, existing in the wide field of sensing technology. Three broadly used commercial varieties of milk, namely skimmed, semi-skimmed, and whole milk types are considered for the test measurements. The overall quality parameters of these products obtained from the market are comparatively measured in terms of their composition and spoilage with reference to ageing. The experiments carried out have illustrated that the sensor was able to distinguish one milk type from another. Moreover, it was also able to differentiate between fresh and aged milk samples of a given milk type as the number of days passes. The methodology used here employs Vector Network Analyser to capture spectral signatures in the form of scattering parameters from electromagnetic wave sensors. These data are then analysed to evaluate quality monitoring process achieved by these sensors.

They mainly deliver products and services in a reactive manner, where the cluster is only facilitating. However, the cluster management can lead business development and assign work packages intelligently to appropriate cluster members by respecting collaboration and innovation. This upgrade of the cluster management requires a systematic approach. Therefore, the intelligent Cluster Assignment Tool concept is developed and an illustrative example is given. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Interviews and workshops were used to isolate the hierarchy of the assignment model, supported by a literature research. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method was applied to determine weights, consolidating data delivered by members of a Turkish aviation and defence cluster. The approach was discussed at the IEEE 2016 ICE Conference in Norway with experts to assess regional restrictions. Findings - Cluster members are actively looking for possibilities to enhance innovation potential that they are ready to participate in systematic approaches. Cluster organizations can differ by leading their members actively, when respecting all isolated dimensions of assignment. This can lead towards a cooperation base enhancing the potential for innovation and new product development (NPD). Research limitations/implications - The illustrative example indicates a good fit to clusters without a dominant anchor firm. The generic framework was deliberated on cross-sectional perspective as satisfactory to be applied to different sectors in developing economies. Practical implications - This paper helps clusters and small organizations to upgrade for innovation. Furthermore, it delivers a strategic tool supporting organizational transformation, preventing the price trap as well. Originality/value - This approach is focussing on multi-criteria assignment across cluster members, upgrading it to a united organization. It delivers a strategic framework for cluster management, building a collaboration environment leading to innovation and NPD. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Analytical hierarchy process (AHP); Fuzzy logic; Innovation; New product development; Supply networks; Virtual organizations","Innovation; Product development; Societies and institutions; Supply chains; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Collaboration environments; Design/methodology/approach; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; New product development; Organizational transformation; Supply networks; Virtual organization; Fuzzy logic",,"Ucler, C.; Faculty of Aviation and Aeronautical Science, Turkey; email: caglar.ucler@gmail.com","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",1741038X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026312304

It concerns in the first instance enterprises, which have an extensive dealer network and focus on deliveries of shot lots on delivery routes. The developed algorithm to make a reasonable management decision concerning the choice of route and delivery schedule gives an opportunity to manage optimally a vehicle fleet and to reduce idle runs. The optimization of delivery routes is based on the minimization of fleet usage, their total run and standing time as well as takes into account traffic intensities on road sections. It allows also to reduce transport load on the road network, which leads to improve ecological situation in the city. The model for the city of NaberezhnyeChelny was built and tested within the scope of research.

This implies integrating complex-process thinking with ecosystems thinking in cases of managing in local foods networks. First, the paper discusses what differentiates this form of food production based on features of interdependencies, information technology, traceability, and complex ecosystems. Supply chain management is expanded to conceptually model local food supply as complex ecosystems. The single case study provides a detailed description of the local foods network of a small Norwegian fresh seafood retailer and wholesaler. Findings include demonstrating the importance of complexity in achieving the sustainable production of local foods, and that this implies management following a paradoxical frame, as opposed to a business model frame. The conceptual model describes how food supply may be considered as an ecosystem mainly driven by economic concerns that are not in conflict with environmental and societal concerns. Since management in food chains is engulfed in a deterministic discourse on how to supply, the model also includes the role of paradoxical framing in managing networked food production operations.

A rigorous and disciplined quantitative approach afforded the tentatively development of pattern of interrelated supply chain dimensions. The factor analysis method was used on 448 responses and insightful findings were produced from the compelling purposive sampling technique. The findings indicate that the magnitude of better ameliorating bullwhip effect, the value of competitive economic information and strength of selected optimization strategies depend on the model of unified engineering patterns. This paper provides insights to FMCG industry on using innovative strategies and modern technology to enhance supply chain visibility through integrated systems networks. © Irena Bakanauskiene, Rita Bendaravičiene, Laima Barkauske, 2017.","Agility; And distribution systems; Bullwhip effect; Inventory; Risk pooling",,,"Mbhele, T.P.; School of Management, South Africa","LLC CPC Business Perspectives",17277051,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024119093

In particular, quantifying environmental impacts is a key aspect of achieving improved product sustainability performance that has garnered much attention over the past two decades, but tools remain deficient to assist manufacturing decision making. In light of efforts undertaken to develop sustainability assessment methodologies, we review recent developments in quantifying a widely adopted environmental performance metric, carbon footprint, in manufacturing processes and supply chain networks. We also present a methodology to address the deficit identified from this review for simple, easy-to-use sustainability assessment methods and tools. We suggest a questionnaire-based methodology to provide non-experts with a better understanding of sustainability performance, specifically during the product design phase. An application of the methodology is demonstrated to quantify and compare environmental impacts for the production of two quadcopter upper shell designs. The review presented can help the sustainable design and manufacturing community in identifying research gaps, while non-expert engineers and engineering students can benefit from application of the presented methodology in learning and in practice. © 2017","Manufacturing and Supply Chain Analysis; Sustainable Design and Manufacturing; Sustainable Engineering Education","Carbon footprint; Decision making; Ecodesign; Engineering education; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Industrial research; Manufacture; Personnel training; Product design; Supply chains; Surveys; Environmental performance; Manufacturing process; Supply chain analysis; Supply chain network; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability performance; Sustainable engineering; Sustainable manufacturing; Sustainable development",,"Raoufi, K.; School of Mechanical, United States; email: raoufik@oregonstate.edu","Elsevier B.V.",23519789,,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023644071

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: A structured questionnaire survey enabled identification of typically significant stakeholders in the PM and FM phases. In total, 14 key stakeholders were identified through t-test analysis in this Sri Lankan study. Semi-structured interviews unveiled relationships among the aforementioned stakeholders and the findings were used to develop the “required” RIVANS-TFM, as well as the “existing” RIVANS-TFM, using the UCINET social network analysis software package. Social network theory of relationships was applied to analyze the networks in terms of “Structural Holes” or missing links and “Brokerage Potentials.” Findings: Structural holes analysis highlighted the existing setup to be more vulnerable to missing links than the “required”/targeted setup. Furthermore, brokerage potentials analysis revealed that owners, project managers, facility managers, maintenance engineers, main contractors, designers, principal consultants, and other specialist consultants can act as “brokers” to bridge the gaps or minimize structural holes, thereby uplifting and reinforcing the existing network to deliver better performance and value in TFM. Originality/value: By revealing existing and required levels of integration of each stakeholder in RIVANS-TFM, clients are provided a great opportunity to identify the stakeholders who should be engaged more, or less – in order to best achieve clients’ long-term aspirations and project objectives. Furthermore, the findings also indicate appropriate levels of stakeholder relationships to target, in order to maintain efficient flows of information, material and services in the supply chains while enhancing TFM life-cycle values. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construction industry; Life-cycle value; Project management; Relationally integrated value networks (RIVANS); Social network; Total facilities management (TFM)",,,"De Silva, N.; Department of Building Economics, Sri Lanka; email: endds@becon.mrt.ac.lk","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",2044124X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023642065

Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory multiple-case study with nine case companies was conducted, including on-site visits, interviews, questionnaires and a workshop. Findings: The authors identified 12 video applications that could improve warehouse operations by making them safer, faster, more transparent and more reliable than they are at present. The authors found that video applications complemented existing information technology and offered a new dimension that provided the real-time analysis of different activities in warehouse operations. The main barriers to implementing video technology included uncertain return on investment, staff integrity, union restrictions and integration with other systems.

The purpose of this paper is to redress this imbalance in the literature through empirical examination of the relationship between SCQM practices and quality performance outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: In accordance with the research aim, a quantitative approach was adopted, and a multi-item scale Web-based survey was designed to collect primary data. A total number of 325 questionnaires were collected from a sample of UK-based manufacturing companies. Factor analysis, internal consistency and multivariate regressions were used to validate the multi-item scale and test the hypotheses. Findings: The findings confirm the proposed hypotheses and reveal statistically significant results for the performance impact of SCQM practices on quality at an aggregate level. However, the results of the individual level analysis of SCQM practices appear to vary from practice to practice. Of various SCQM practices, customer focus with the highest beta value (i.e. ß = 0.303; t-value = 6.120; p = 0.000) was found to have the greatest impact on quality performance. Practical implications: The findings encourage managers to place high priority on both inter-firm and intra-firm relationships as prerequisites for achieving superior quality performance. The propositions and the results of the study provide managers with some guidelines about effective management of upstream, midstream and downstream supply chain networks and awareness of the potential synergies arising from the combined effects of SCQM practices that could bring about desired quality performance outcomes across the entire supply chain network. Originality/value: Real and sustainable quality performance often requires an equal focus on both intra- and inter-firm relationships among supply chain partners. Therefore, effective management of quality across the entire supply chain is deemed essential if a firm is to smoothly supply high-quality products and services to customers. But little research has been devoted to understanding conceptual underpinnings of SCQM as well as empirical support and validation for the conceptualisation and measurement of SCQM practices. Based on the insights gained from social network theory, this paper makes an attempt to address this gap and examine the impact of SCQM practices on quality performance. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Performance; Quality management; Supply-chain management; Surveys",,,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",13598546,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023162660

Supply and demand for ecosystem services can effectively characterize the level of ecological supply and demand for the establishment of green space ecological networks. This research provides a scheme for zoning Guangdong Province based on a supply and demand analysis at a county scale. The supply of ecosystem services was calculated by modified values of ecosystem services, whereas the demand of ecosystem services was represented by land use intensity, population density, and GDP per area. The results show that all the counties could be sorted into four types. The first type is an urban ecological conservation node, which contains 13 counties with good ecological supply and high ecological demand. Urban construction should focus on the integrated functions of large green spaces, such as recreation, science, and education. The second type is an urban habitat patch repair node, which contains 34 counties with poor ecological supply and high ecological demand. Urban construction should increase capital investment to perfect green infrastructure. The third type is a suburban potential remodeling node, containing 21 counties with poor ecological supply and low ecological demand. Urban construction should be eco-oriented. Based on industrial reconstruction, it is possible to optimize regional ecological space through rural urban financing. The fourth type is a suburban source network connectivity node, including 55 counties with good ecological supply and low ecological demand. This type should strengthen ecological source protection and guarantee continued delivery of ecosystem services to the surrounding areas. This zoning scheme could generally characterize spatial differences of ecological supply and demand, and aims to provide ecological network planning guidelines for green space construction. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

Despite the advantages of big open data for supply chain and operations management, there is severe shortage of empirical analyses in this field, especially with regard to its acceptance.

Largely in Malaysia, F&B industries are dominated by this scale of enterprises. However, in terms of the halal products manufactured are not produced by those enterprises, but made by large and multinational enterprises. Presently, there is an enormous competition among those enterprises to produce halal products on a large scale all along the supply-chain networks. On the other hand, most of them are stuck to getting halal certificates from the official authority; JAKIM. Besides that, other challenges faced by SMEs that they are deficient of leadership styles, lack of entrepreneurial orientation and inconsistent performance to grasp opportunities existing in the halal markets. Based on previous literatures, these challenges contributed a significant research gap in terms of leaderships in management practice towards the organisation performance. Therefore, this study has constructed a conceptual model based on the leadership theories in which they have a significant impact on an organisation's performance. This paper presents a proposal of a theoretical framework in order to examine the relationship of leadership styles, mainly the spirituality towards the organisation performance which moderates by Shariah based entrepreneurial orientation. All measurements applied in the study are based from the past research. However, some of them are modified suited to the study's objectives.

First, the paper describes three strategies that can be taken by the high-carbon suppliers considering the low carbon constraints and in the face of customers' low-carbon preferences. Then, we build three game models for different strategies, and get the optimal decision for each enterprise of the supply chain by using the backward induction and marginal analytical method. Finally, the paper compares the profits of each enterprise of the supply chain under three different strategies, and discusses the reasonable proportion of carbon reduction cost when supplier cooperates with manufacturers to reduce the carbon emissions.

Despite this fact, in Iran and many other developing countries, they have not had remarkable successes in this regard. Because strategy formulation and management is a plan to obtain far-reaching development effects of any organization. This study aimed to present a hybrid method to formulate and choose strategies for rural cooperatives development. It combined SWOT analysis, TOWS matrix, and the Analytic Network Process (ANP). We applied brainstorming technique to analyze the external and internal environment of rural cooperatives using the contributions of an experts’ team comprising 10 individual CEOs of rural cooperatives and senior employees of the Central Organization of Rural Cooperatives. When this team identified key SWOT factors, TOWS matrix was constructed to create good strategic alternatives. Finally, ANP was applied to prioritize the strategies. According to results, 19 key strategic factors such as lack of management knowledge (W4), and ability to improve value and supply chains (S4) were identified. In addition, this team identified 11 strategic alternatives which among them Implement public policy and provide technical and financial services (SO2), Facilitate procurement of inputs and develop supply and value chains (SO1) and Involve rural cooperatives in policy planning (ST1), had greater priority in Iran.

Increasing the efficiency of upstream and downstream operations while maximizing shale gas project profitability became the best strategy for offsetting low oil and gas prices. This work suggests a multidisciplinary approach for the design and optimization of a given shale gas supply chain network. This integrated approach incorporates realistic drilling, completion and stimulation strategies through the compositional modelling of a geologically heterogeneous shale gas reservoir. Previous work in this area considered mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization models with minimal consideration for pragmatic shale gas reservoir development. This resulted in grossly over-estimated shale gas project NPV's and impractical payback times. A 3D coupled compositional reservoir model is constructed using CMG's software suites, to simulate drilling, completion, stimulation (DCS) and well pad production processes for a supply chain network. Utilizing geological parameters, characteristic of the Marcellus shale, this model generates realistic wastewater and gas rate decline profiles as well as the temporal variation of shale gas components, which are inputs for Quasi-MINLP optimization in General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS). The results show that the optimization of shale gas production and project NPV are rarely obtained from singular and mathematically convenient well pad design configurations. Reservoir heterogeneity and realistic DCS strategies have a huge influence on the techno-economics of shale gas projects.

Our case study is Millau, a small French town (23,000 inhabitants) located in a highland area famous for its Roquefort cheese. To address food relocalization as a spatial phenomenon, we developed a multi-scale and extensive foodshed cartography based on statistical data, interviews, questionnaires and field observations. Our paper confirms the relocalization trend (between 2006 and 2014 the foodshed of local supply chains expanded by 18.3%). At the same time it shows that the share of local food in the total urban supply is low: we estimate it at 6%. It helps to figure out the spatial shape of ""local"" agricultural areas producing for the city: they consist of isolated plots scattered in a countryside structured by far-reaching supply chains. The local foodshed grows as a result of the growing urban demand for local food, but not at the same locations as formerly. These results show the interest of studying the spatial imprint of urban food on farmland at various scales: that of the city-countryside tandem, as well as at the regional scale and at the city network scale. © 2017 NSS-Dialogues, EDP Sciences.","Alternative food networks; Farmland; Food relocalization; Foodshed; Territory","agricultural land; demand analysis; food market; food supply; spatial analysis; urban agriculture; urban area; urban economy; France; Millau",,"Baysse-Lainé, A.; Géographe, France; email: abl@posteo.eu","EDP Sciences",12401307,,NSCSE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021421701

Storage facilities, as a part of supply chain are designed to provide customers availability of goods at a certain time, quantity and place. This involves the functions resulting therefrom, such as storage, sorting, picking, packing, etc. The efficiency of processes in the supply chains is strongly influenced by the location and shape of the storage facilities that are critical components. These issues are multi-threaded, and they are subject of an iterative approach in which information tools are playing a special role. One of such tool is the SIMMAG3D system. It is a system for modelling and visualization in 3D of warehouse facilities, which was built based on developed mathematical models, computational algorithms and functional dependencies necessary for the designing of storage facilities. It also takes into account the different types of warehouses and design methodologies as well as the location of warehouses in the logistic network. The article presents the elements of the SIMMAG3D system and characterizes its functional capabilities.

Upstream sectors lobby more when US affiliates of foreign firms that procure inputs from their own supply chains gain market share at the expense of domestic firms in investment-receiving sectors. In contrast, downstream sectors lobby less when they save input procurement costs as domestic and foreign firms compete to produce quality goods at a lower price.

However, it is less known whether adopting such practices affects the innovation performance of the focal firm. This study hypothesises that supplier collaboration practices in four specific areas (green and ethical supply management, early supplier involvement, systemic purchasing and inter-firm learning) may lead to higher focal firm innovation performance, as they require the firm to adopt new business models, processes and product features. Design/methodology/approach: The hypotheses drawn from previous research are tested with a quantitative survey study of 165 Finnish firms and analysed by means of regression analysis. Findings: The results show that two examined practices are positively related to focal firm innovation performance: systemic purchasing and green and ethical supply management. Interestingly, early supplier involvement and inter-firm learning did not influence innovation performance. Originality/value: Little is known about whether adopting certain practices in supply management affects the innovation performance of the firm. In fact, among the performance indicators of supply management, innovation is rarely studied, and more studies using innovation as a performance indicator are called for.

With a clear focus on 'whole of life' multi-mode transport infrastructure, the asset standards authority has led an unprecedented program of engagement centred on competency and capability development across the supply chain. In concert with this, the authority has developed focused relationships with global academia and R&D entities - providing the 'asset-owners' perspective and drawing on the considerable intellect that the relationship offers.

Its definition and scope are still evolving since early 1980s. But, collection, sorting/testing, recovery and redistribution are assumed as the basic four activities in reverse logistics. Unfortunately, many researchers assume reverse logistics by its literary meaning and plan the reverse logistic activities and take decisions based on the forward logistics or supply chain principles. There is hardly any academic research on the performance evaluation and decision variables for reverse logistics. This paper aims at developing the various activities, decision variables and performance indicators based on the four basic activities under reverse logistics. The three basic questions - who will collect from the customer, what is to be done on the collected products and where to send after recovery - interlinked with the activities at collection, sorting/testing and recovery centres will provide the basic activities, decision variables and key performance indicators of the reverse logistics. The location and capacity of various centres, types of networks, various recovery options, various methods of collection, and seamless integration with the forward logistics are the key decision variables. The performance indicators will be developed based on the activities and actions between the activities so that the performance indicators can be associated with the reverse logistics. It is expected that this conceptual framework of activities, decision variables and performance indicators will help the managers working in reverse logistics to take better and informed decisions. © 2017 The Authors.","closed loop supply chain; collection methods; performance indicators; recovery options; Reverse logistics","Benchmarking; Decision making; Life cycle; Recovery; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; Collection methods; Conceptual frameworks; Key performance indicators; Performance indicators; Reverse logistics; Seamless integration; Sustainable production; Logistics",,"Sangwan, K.S.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, India; email: kss@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in","Elsevier B.V.",22128271,,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020030841

The organ procurement organisation (OPO) should coordinate so that organs are prepared and transported to the recipients when donors become available. The scarcity of organ supply leads to life-challenging issues for the organ recipient. In this research, the importance of the location of OPOs to coordinate with the transplant centres in India is considered, and a solution is provided by facilitating the identification of locations where organs can be procured and distributed to the nearest transplant location. The location of the distribution centres of organs are identified, based on the p-median model. This model minimises the weighted distance of the organ recipients. Initially, the demand or the population density of organ recipients with respect to particular location is recognised. Then, based on the p-median model, the location of OPOs is effectively identified. Experimental analysis proves that the proposed model performs well in facilitating the location of OPOs. The robustness of the proposed work is validated using a sensitivity analysis of the differences in the selection of OPOs when the estimated demand for organs varies. © 2017, South African Institute of Industrial Engineering.

Each generator and load are regarded as an agent of a supplier and a demander, respectively, in which an economic dispatch (ED) and demand response (DR) can be simultaneously solved by DTQ. To maximize the total payoff of all the agents, a virtual leader-follower pattern is employed to achieve a reliable collaboration among the agents. Then, Q-learning with a cooperative swarm is adopted for the knowledge learning for each agent via appropriate explorations and exploitations in an unknown environment. Furthermore, the original extremely large-scale knowledge matrix can be efficiently decomposed into several simplified small-scale knowledge matrices through a binary state-action chain, while the continuous actions can be generated for continuous variables. Lastly, a deep belief network (DBN) is used for knowledge transfer, thus DTQ can effectively exploit the prior knowledge from source tasks so as to rapidly obtain an optimal solution of a new task.

This introductory chapter discusses the genesis of this book and its structure, explaining the reasons for its multidisciplinary approach to studying the liabilities emerging in local contexts and relating to the separation between the immigrants and the native firms and communities. Immigrant entrepreneurship is an increasingly important phenomenon driven by growing immigration, entrepreneurial attitude diffusion among the immigrants, and the globalization of markets and supply chains. Immigrant entrepreneurs can experience liabilities similar to the liabilities of foreignness and of outsidership in their local networks, while being insiders to the global networks that are dominant in their specific industries and markets. Native entrepreneurs can experience a relative outsidership from the new global networks dominated by international entrepreneurship. The focus on local liabilities affords a unique perspective on the nature of globalization. Although the book applies the theme in reference to the case of Prato in Italy, the goal is to provide useful information to address a global phenomenon. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Foreignness; Immigrant entrepreneurship; Multidisciplinary approach; Native entrepreneurship; Outsidership",,,"Guercini, S.; University of FlorenceItaly; email: simone.guercini@unifi.it","Springer International Publishing",,9783319441115; 9783319441108,,Editorial,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019908763

The study aims to obtain a rational tradeoff between environmental influence and total cost. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is developed to determine the optimal location and size of regional distribution centers (RDCs) and the investment of environmental facilities considering the effects of economies of scale and CO2 emission taxes. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the applications of the proposed model. Moreover, comparative analysis of the related key parameters is conducted (i.e., carbon emission tax, logistics demand of customers, and economies of scale of RDC), to explore the corresponding effects on the network design of a green supply chain. Moreover, the proposed model is applied in an actual case—network design ofa supply chain of an electric meter company in China. Findings show that (i) the optimal location of RDCs is affected by the demand of customers and the level of economies of scale and that (ii) the introduction of CO2 emission taxes will change the structure of a supply chain network, which will decrease CO2 emissions per unit shipment. © 2017 Dezhi Zhang et al.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Supply chains; Comparative analysis; Environmental concerns; Environmental influences; Green supply chain; Manufacturing enterprise; Mixed integer nonlinear programming models; Regional distribution centers; Supply chain network; Economics",,"Li, S.; School of Transportation and Logistics, China; email: lishuangyan585@163.com","Hindawi Limited",01976729,,JATRD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019763653

The traceability unit turnaround time is employed to predict the flow state and estimate the historical flow route. The distribution of the turnaround time is estimated by historical data of the food chain. And the route estimation optimisation model is constructed, according to the distribution of traceability unit turnaround time among nodes and the minimum difference between the total time of route between two points and the given time. Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate the time distribution of the route and verify the feasibility of traceability unit flow route.

Biomass is bulky, so transportation modes such as rail and barge can be used to deliver this product. For this reason, this study focuses on multimodal supply chain designs for biofuel. Biomass supply is highly seasonal, but the high production seasons for biomass in the Southeast United States often coincide with or are followed by hurricanes, and drought seasons, both of which impact transportation. The dynamic multimodel transportation network design model this paper presents enables this supply chain to cope with biomass supply fluctuations and to hedge against natural disasters. The mixed-integer nonlinear programming model proposed is an NP-hard problem, and we develop an accelerated Benders decomposition algorithm and a hybrid rolling horizon algorithm to solve this problem.We tested the performance of the algorithm on a case study using data from the Southeast United States. The numerical experiments show that this proposed algorithm can solve large-scale problem instances to a near optimal solution in a reasonable time. Numerical analyses indicate that, under normal conditions, the minimum cost model outperforms the reliable models. However, under disaster scenarios, the minimum cost model is 2.65% to 9.20% more expensive than the reliable and static model and 6.28% to 17.73% more expensive than the reliable and dynamic model. Thus, the reliable and dynamic multimodal network design decisions can aid biofuel supply chain management decisions, especially when considering the potential impacts of natural disasters. © 2016 INFORMS.","Benders decomposition; Biofuel supply chain network; Dynamic multimodal transportation model; Rolling horizon heuristic","Biofuels; Biomass; Computational complexity; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Disasters; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Stochastic programming; Supply chain management; Transportation; Benders decomposition; Benders decomposition algorithm; Biofuel supply chains; Mixed integer nonlinear programming models; Multimodal transportation networks; Rolling horizon; Rolling-horizon algorithms; Supply chain network design; Multimodal transportation","NSF: 1462420, CMMI 1052671; MDOT: SPR-1(66)/106461-179000","Marufuzzaman, M.; Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, United States; email: maruf@ise.msstate.edu","INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences",00411655,,TRSCB,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019660269

The proposed method is based on projecting the ratio of bottom and top level series into the future, rather than using average historical proportions and proportions of the historical averages, as in standard top down approaches. Forecasted projections are then used for determining how the ""base"" forecasts of the top series will be distributed to the revised forecasts for every series at the bottom level of the hierarchy. Revised forecasts for all series in the hierarchy are obtained in the same manner as in standard top down methodology. In order to estimate the accuracy of the proposed model, the simulation study is performed. Results demonstrate that the ""modified"" top down model significantly outperforms standard top down approaches. Beside comparison with the top down approach, the model is compared with the bottom up method, and two newly proposed approaches: top down forecasted proportions and optimal combination approach. Overall, the bottom up method shows the lowest forecasting error. Results also reveal that the modified top down model demonstrates good performance, since its forecasts are close to the forecasts of the top performing model.

Waste transport from producers to the pre-processing facilities and/or plants for final treatment significantly contributes to overall processing cost and should be properly investigated to select the most convenient solution. The main goal of this paper is to describe comprehensive techno-economic model involving several types of transportation systems (for example collecting vehicles, transfer stations, intermodal container system). Each transportation system has been analysed according to its specific parameters that is transport distance, amount of waste transported, etc. The results of the calculation (for example specific cost per ton and kilometer) then serve as inputs for detailed supply chain optimisation involving complex networks. Correct implementation of transportation cost with relation to other system key parameters (for example distance, capacity of waste) enables getting more reliable output data. In the paper, authors described methods of optimisation task simplification without losing exactness of real solution. The impact on computational time will be addressed and concrete results related to real industrial case study in the field of waste-To-energy is presented.

Design/methodology/approach: A two-step hierarchical approach is developed. First, Economic Input-Output-based Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) is utilized to quantify the GHG emissions associated with the US residential, commercial and industrial building stock. Second, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based optimization framework is developed to identify the optimal GHG emissions’ reduction (percent) for each industry across the supply chain network of the US economy. Findings: The results indicated that “ready-mix concrete manufacturing”, “electric power generation, transmission and distribution” and “lighting fixture manufacturing” sectors were found to be the main culprits in the GHG emissions’ stock. Additionally, the majorly responsible industries in the supply chains of each building construction categories were also highlighted as the hot-spots in the supply chains with respect to the GHG emission reduction (percent) requirements. Practical implications: The decision making in terms of construction-related expenses and energy use options have considerable impacts across the supply chains. Therefore, regulations and actions should be re-organized around the systematic understanding considering the principles of “circular economy” within the context of sustainable development. Originality/value: Although the literature is abundant with works that address quantifying environmental impacts of building structures, environmental life cycle impact-based optimization methods are scarce. This paper successfully fills this gap by integrating EIO-LCA and MILP frameworks to identify the most pollutant industries in the supply chains of building structures. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Carbon footprint; Green buildings; Green supply chain management; Input-output life cycle assessment; Optimization",,,"Egilmez, G.; Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, United States; email: gokhanegilmez@gmail.com","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14777835,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019199923

Reusing and recycling waste from disasters are essential for sustainable debris management. Before recycling the debris, it is necessary to sort this mixed waste. To perform the sorting process efficiently, a Temporary Disaster Debris Management Site (TDDMS) is required, and the selection of TDDMS is a multi-criteria decision-making problem due to its numerous regional and municipal constraints. This paper provides a two-phase framework for sustainable debris management during the response phase of disasters. In the first phase, a methodology for TDDMS selection is proposed that consists of Analytical Network Process (ANP) and a fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). In the second phase, a debris allocation optimization model is developed to allocate the debris from disaster-affected regions to the selected TDDMS. A city prone to hurricane damage is selected to illustrate the proposed framework. For the debris allocation purpose, five TDDMS are chosen, among which three sites are selected using the proposed methodology. To illustrate the utilization of the proposed study, a numerical example with two different scenarios is provided. Numerical outcomes prove that the model results in a sustainable debris management system for disasters. © 2017 by the authors.","Disaster debris management; Disaster debris supply chain; Fuzzy possibilistic optimization; Fuzzy TOPSIS; Multi-criteria decision-making","decision making; disaster management; fuzzy mathematics; hurricane; integrated approach; location-allocation model; multicriteria analysis; optimization; recycling; supply chain management; sustainability; waste management",,"Sarkar, B.; Department of Industrial and Management Engineering, South Korea; email: bsbiswajitsarkar@gmail.com","MDPI",20711050,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019107064

To compete in this virtual arena, picking, packing and shipping single items and small volume orders to customers, needs to be done as efficiently as possible. Orders require delivery to customers - not weekly or bi-weekly as with retail stores, but typically within 24 to 72 hours. In a conventional marketplace supply chain model, the sellers make the goods ready based on customer orders and signal to their logistics partner for a pickup. The supply chain activities typically start with the consolidation of load for a given geography and then distributed within the supply chain network. In this paper, we propose an analytical model to estimate the sortation wave timings in a marketplace distribution center to optimize transport TAT's subject to inbound load profile, sortation capacity at a distribution center, transport mode and lane-wise load split and transit time between destinations. The model which has been tested by simulations with different illustrative examples, works on the logic of earliest deadline first scheduling algorithm to maximize the desired objective function. Each destination has a transport cut-off before which its corresponding load needs to be sorted and bagged for dispatch. The model aims to improve the transport TAT's without increasing the design cost of the distribution center or the transportation network. © IEOM Society International.","Distribution center; E-commerce; Logistics; Sortation; Wave-design",,,,"IEOM Society",21698767,9780985549763,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019000059

In this paper, medical demands are classified into two types of flexible and non-flexible demands based on their transfer costs. Also, medical facilities are divided into two classes depending on their medical service capacity. In a practical hospital network model, relative medical service satisfaction index for patients was defined in consideration of medical care and the related cost under condition that medical demand can be transferred if necessary. The mathematical model is suggested with a satisfaction constraints, and the solution is found approximately using linear transformation applied on the loss function and normal distribution. Through the experiment, it was shown that when the average medical service satisfaction level was increased to a certain level or higher, and that the social cost was reduced as well as the total cost. Optimization on the total cost of the multi-level network with reasonable satisfaction can be accomplished by relocating the medical demands and facility capacity.

Logistics cost of a shipment is a function of distance & speed of the shipment travel in a particular network , its volumetric size and dead weight. Logistics billing is based mainly on the consumption of the scarce resource (space or weight carrying capacity of a carrier). Shipment's size or deadweight is a function of product and packaging weight, dimensions and flexibility. Hence, to arrive at a standard methodology to compute accurate cost to bill the customer, the interplay among above mentioned physical attributes along with their measurement plays key role. This becomes even more complex for an e-commerce company, like Flipkart, which caters to shipments from both warehouse and marketplace in an unorganized non-standard market like India. In this paper, we'll explore various methodologies to define a standard way of billing the non-standard shipments across wide range of size, shape and deadweight. Those will be, usage of historical volumetric / dead weight data to arrive at a factor which can be used to compute the logistics cost of a shipment, also calculating the real/contour volume of a shipment to address the problem of irregular shipment shapes which cannot be solved by conventional bounding box volume measurements. We'll also discuss certain key business practices and operational quality considerations needed to bring standardization and drive appropriate ownership in the ecosystem. © IEOM Society International.","Contour volume; Deadweight; Logistics; Logistics cost; Real volume; Volumetric weight",,,,"IEOM Society",21698767,9780985549763,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018992218

Primary goal of the supply chain strategy is to meet customer expectation by offering fastest deliveries, while keeping the cost minimal. Meeting this objective at the large market that India provides is the problem statement that we have targeted here. There are many models and optimization techniques focused on network design to identify the ideal facility location and size, optimizing cost and speed. In this paper we are presenting a tactical approach to optimize cost of an existing network for a predefined speed. We have considered both forward and reverse logistics of a retail e-commerce supply chain consisting of multiple fulfilment (warehouse) and delivery centers, which are connected via sortation nodes. The mathematical model presented here determines if the shipment from a node should get sorted directly for the last mile delivery center or it should travel as consolidated package to another node for further sortation (resort). The objective function minimizes the total cost by varying the resort percentages between nodes and provides the optimal resource allocation and number of sorts at each node. © IEOM Society International.","Mathematical model; Sortation and distribution strategy; Supply chain network",,,,"IEOM Society",21698767,9780985549763,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018964982

It requires a good management in order to enhance hospital performance. This paper describes a model of designing the distribution network of health products within hospitals. Different scenarios are studied using multi-criteria analysis in order to identify the most appropriate design of the hospital supply chain in terms of costs reduction, accessibility and quality of care improvement. Purpose: Define the most performing supply chain design based on three criteria: costs, accessibility and quality. Design/methodology/approach: The analytic hierarchy process (AHP): a structured technique that assist decision makers to choose the best solution in complex situations taking in account multiple decision criteria. Findings and Originality/value: This paper proposes to compare between six organizational scenarios of the hospital distribution network and in the end, to choose the most appropriate one based on three criteria: quality of services, accessibility and costs. Based on the AHP method, among the healthcare supply chain designs reviewed in the case study, the highest performance for pharmacies grouping is obtained by reducing costs and increasing the health products availability and quality. This grouping doesn't concern all the medicines and medical devices but only a part of them. The three organizational scenarios that represents the grouping of all health products (the second, the fourth and the fifth) occupy the last three ranks. The actual situation occupies the third rank. That is to say, that the reorganization of the hospital distribution network is required to improve the hospital performance. Originality/value: The use of the AHP method to choose the most appropriate design of healthcare supply chain in a case study based on three decision criteria: costs, accessibility to health products and quality.

Since the last decade, the e-commerce market is characterized by enormous growth and changes. This growth has caused and still causes major inefficiencies within the delivery to customer part of the supply chain known as 'last mile'. On the other hand, pickup from the sellers, to bring goods into the supply chain also known as 'first mile' creates opportunities of marginal utilization in the city-logistics supply chain. Urban areas represent great challenges for logistic organizations for better economic efficiency in order to meet seller and customer requirements. We initially investigated standard clustering techniques such as partitioning based clustering (k-means, k-mediods), hierarchical clustering (agglomerative, divisive) and density based clustering (dbscan, optics). Being a multivariate optimization problem, we develop a hybrid clustering model to generate time-constrained and resource-constrained clusters. These clusters also help to identify optimal hub locations to act as starting points for seller pick-up and customer delivery activities. This dynamic model will improve the productivity of resources considering the supply load variability and unpredictable demand nodes. The vehicular routing within a cluster to calculate the travel time is done using the meta-heuristic method of ant colony optimization (ACO). This clustering model will help to reorganize logistics more efficiently and deal with urban logistics challenges. © IEOM Society International.","City logistics; Clustering; E-commerce; Resource optimization",,,,"IEOM Society",21698767,9780985549763,,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018948652

Pharmaceutical supply chain network faces different risks at every stage of the chain. While the end user of a pharmaceutical supply chain is patients, it becomes more important to manage and minimize the risks in the system. There are some methodologies that are used for this aim. Minimizing many risks at the same time requires a multi objective solution methodology. A fuzzy based goal programming model is proposed to minimize the risk factors in a pharmaceutical supply chain in this paper. Linguistic expressions are used to define the importance of risks. To increase a deep and sensitive analysis, the fuzzy set theory is adopted in the proposed methodology that consists of fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and goal programming (GP).

Among strategic decisions, supplier selection and evaluation outranks other decisions in terms of importance due to its long-term impacts. Besides, the adoption of such strategic decision entails exploring several factors that contribute to the complexity of decision making in the supply chain. For the purpose of solving non-linear regression problems, a novel neural network technique known as least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM) with maximum generalization ability has successfully been implemented. However, the performance quality of the LS-SVM is recognized to notoriously vary depending on the rigorous selection of its parameters. Therefore, in this paper, a continuous general variable neighborhood search (CGVNS) which is an effective meta-heuristic algorithm to solve the real world engineering continuous optimization problems is proposed to be integrated with LS-SVM. The CGVNS is hybridized in our novel integrated LS-SVM and CGVNS model, to tune the parameters of the LS-SVM to better estimate performance rating of supplier selection and evaluation problem. To demonstrate the improved performance of our proposed integrated model, a real data set from a case study of a supplier selection and evaluation problem is presented in a cosmetics industry. Additionally, comparative evaluations between our proposed model and the conventional techniques, namely nonlinear regression, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network and LS-SVM is provided.

Despite this, there is limited information in South Africa on the perceptions of supply chain players regarding cost reduction in the mobile phone industry. Furthermore, there is currently no framework for reducing supply chain costs in the South African mobile phone industry. Aim: The purpose of this study is to explore supply chain costs in the South African mobile phone industry, and to develop a supply chain cost-reduction framework for the South African mobile phone industry. Setting: This study explores supply chain costs in four mobile phone companies operating in the South African mobile phone industry, of which three mobile network operators and one mobile retailing group. It uses semi-structured interview data collected in 2011. Method: This study adopted a qualitative case study design to understand supply chain costs and develop a supply chain cost-reduction framework for the South African mobile phone industry. Eight semi-structured interviews with managers of mobile phone companies were conducted. The data were analysed with the help of Atlas.ti, using an adapted three-phased analytical framework as suggested by Miles and Huberman (1994) and O’ Dwyer (2004). Results: The study found that consolidation of strategic relationships through collaboration and strategic alliances between MNOs and other supply chain players is one of the ways to drive costs down across the supply chain. Outsourcing of some of the support activities and retailers’ direct purchasing transactions from device manufacturers were also found to be other avenues for reducing supply chain costs in the industry. Conclusion: The study suggests that mobile network operators (MNOs) need to consolidate their strategic relationships by increasing the share of the network infrastructure, and emphasising the need to strive for operational efficiencies. This combined effort should result in significant cost reductions across the supply chain. The findings of this study provided some avenues that managers of mobile-phone companies could consider to drive costs down supply chain-wide and service end-users at lower rates. The findings of this study could also help regulating authorities to get insights into supply chain cost reduction and develop appropriate mobile phone policies in South Africa. © 2017.

Many oncogenic mutations that may potentially lead to tumor angiogenesis have been identified. Somatic mutations in the small GTPase NRAS are the most common activating lesions found in human cancer and are generally associated with poor response to standard therapies. However, the mechanisms by which NRAS mutations affect tumor angiogenesis are largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the role of NRASQ61K oncogene in tumor angiogenesis and analyzed tumors harboring NRASQ61K for potential sensitivity to a kinase inhibitor. Knock-in of the NRASQ61K allele in human normal epithelial cells triggered the angiogenic response in these cells. In cancer cells harboring oncogenic NRAS, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor down-regulated the extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway and inhibited the expression of proangiogenic molecules. In tumor xenografts harboring the NRASQ61K, the MEK inhibitor extensively modified tumor growth, causing abrogation of angiogenesis. Overall, our results provide a functional link between oncogenic NRAS and angiogenesis, and imply that tumor vasculature could be indirectly altered by targeting a genetic lesion on which cancer cells are dependent.","Angiogenesis; NRAS; NSCLC","trametinib; angiogenesis; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; cell invasion assay; cell viability assay; chorioallantoic membrane assay; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; gene mutation; gene targeting; human; human cell; immunoprecipitation; mouse; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; oncogene N ras; real time polymerase chain reaction; tumor growth; tumor vascularization; tumor volume; tumor xenograft; Western blotting; wound healing assay",,"Song, Z.; Department of Interventional Radiology, No.16, Xinhua West Road, China; email: songzhaoweis@outlook.com","E-Century Publishing Corporation",21566976,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018251977

Developments in the supply chain design and analysis have helped coal mining and coal trading companies expand their businesses, but at the same time, have forced them to consolidate their assets and downsize any underused storage facilities. In the coal mining industry, the problem of consolidation and downsizing becomes much more complicated due to the variety in quality parameters (hence many coal grades) involved, locational zones and different number of market players. Furthermore, for the last decade, the storage allocation and assignment problem has received a great deal of attention within the Logistics and Operation Research (OR) area. Yet, little attention has been given to the modeling of coal supply chains and the issue of strategic supply chain planning of coal-producing and coal-trading companies. Similar to the generic warehouse consolidation problem (WCP), in specific cases of coal-producing and coal-trading companies, storage facilities that are redundant or underutilized can be eliminated without causing a negative impact on customer and service levels. In this context, this paper discusses the background of the problem and proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model mainly intended for storage and distribution network reconfiguration of a coal-producing or trading company. The model, which can be implemented in a high-level mathematical modelling system such as GAMS or AIMMS, captures the essential methodological features of a warehouse restructuring and/or consolidation problem and can be applied in practice. © 2017, Polska Akademia Nauk.

Faraday discovered the concept of mutual induction, which forms the basis for powering passive tags operating in the near field. Technological advances enabling the development of far-field tags occurred during the first half of the twentieth century. This chapter focuses on passive tags operating in the far field. Far-field tags must harvest energy to operate and backscatter the interrogation signal transmitted by the reader to communicate with the reader. Two discoveries form the basis for far-field passive RFID tags. First, the development of crystal set radios provides the basis for a tag to power itself. Crystal set radios used energy contained in the radio frequency (RF) signal to move a diaphragm in the headset enabling those without electricity (most people outside a major city during the early twentieth century) to listen to radio broadcasts. Second, discoveries in the field of radar during the Second World War form the basis for the backscatter communication employed by passive RFID tags. All objects refiect radio waves, and the tag can change the characteristics of the radio waves it refiects by changing the matching at the connection between the chip and the antenna making up the tag. These two discoveries form the basis of far-field passive RFID tags. There are many types of RFID tags in existence, and although this chapter focuses on passive RFID tags, a brief introduction of the other types of RFID tags is presented in this section. EPCglobal designates four classes of RFID tags. Class 1 and Class 2 tags are purely passive tags with Class 2 being a Class 1 tag with additional memory or supporting additional protocol commands. Semipassive tags, designated as Class 3 and Class 4, are active tags. Semipassive tags have an onboard power source and may have onboard sensors. The onboard power source serves two purposes: (1) it provides continuous power for the sensors and (2) it allows the intelligence contained in the chip to function without harvesting energy. When monitoring an asset, it is critical to take sensor readings at the required intervals to obtain a complete history of the asset with respect to a given phenomenon. The onboard power supply ensures that the semipassive tag can take these readings even in the absence of a reader to power the tag. Another use of semipassive tags is to increase the read range or to read the tag in an unfriendly environment. Because the chip in a semipassive tag is powered by the battery, the semipassive tag is not required to harvest energy for operation from the reader signal. Hence, a semipassive tag does not need to harvest energy to power the circuitry for the backscatter communication to produce a stronger signal that is easier for the reader to detect, resulting in increased range or the capability to be read in an unfriendly environment. Semipassive tags are currently investigated for use in the cold chain, where items (such as frozen foods or drugs) must be kept below a given temperature. Active tags have an onboard power supply, active receiver, distinct active transmitter, and may talk with each other and form a network. Active tags are very similar to nodes in a sensor network. ZigBee and IEEE 802.11 networks can be considered as containing active tags using a very broad definition of active tags. One standard defining a network of active tags, ISO 18000-7, does not permit tag-to-tag communication, but only communications between a tag and a reader. Because of the active transmitter, active tags can transmit a signal to a reader several hundred meters away. Similarly, the active receiver enables the active tag to receive a very weak signal from devices up to several hundred meters away. The active communications hardware enables active tags to be used in places with large amounts of metal, which is typically very unfriendly to passive and semipassive tags. As more memory can be incorporated into an active tag, it is often used to store information about a shipment of goods in a shipping container. Active tags may incorporate sensors. With active tags, battery life is critical as an active tag cannot harvest energy from the reader signal as a passive or semipassive tag can. Passive tags are the cheapest of the four but have the least capability. Passive tags are commonly used to track items functioning as a wireless barcode. Semipassive tags are more expensive than passive tags, but cheaper than active tags, with capabilities falling in the middle as well. Because of their cost, semipassive tags are ideal in cases where a large number of assets must be monitored (with sensors), or in situations where the tag cannot be reused. Active tags are the most expensive, but offer the greatest capabilities. Currently, the military and highway drivers (EZ-Pass) are the primary users of active tags.

Further, it finds evidence that buyers are more likely to source from MNC suppliers when they source a wider variety of products, have smaller supplier networks, or have smaller order volumes.

However, the typical concepts have techno-economic issues: limited replacement in co-processing with fossil sources and high investment costs in integration to a specific plant. These issues have directed the current investigations to supply-chain network systems. On the other hand, these studies have the scope of a specific product and/or a feedstock type. This paper proposes a novel biorefinery concept for lignocellulosic biomass: sectoral integration network and a new hydrothermal process for biomass conversion. The sectoral integration concept has the potential for sustainable production from biomass: pre-treatment at the biomass sites, regional distributed conversion of biomass from various sectors (e.g. black liquor, sawdust, straw) and centralized upgrading/separation of crude biofuels. On the other hand, the conversion processes compose the vital part of such a concept. The new conversion involves partial wet oxidation - or simultaneous dissolution with partial wet oxidation for solid biomass- followed by lignin recovery with acidification and a reactor that can perform either hydrothermal liquefaction or supercritical water gasification. The process can intake both liquid and solid biomass to produce lignin as biomaterial and syngas or bio-oil. The new concept can contribute social development of rural areas by utilizing waste as valuable raw material for the production of multiple products and reduce the net greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil-based production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Hydrothermal liquefaction; Integrated biorefinery; Partial wet oxidation; Supercritical water gasification; Supply-chain network","Bioconversion; Biofuels; Gas emissions; Gasification; Greenhouse gases; Integration; Investments; Lignin; Liquefaction; Oxidation; Refining; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Integrated biorefinery; Supercritical water gasification; Supply chain network; Wet oxidation; Biomass",,"Özdenkçi, K.; Department of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering, Finland; email: karhan.ozdenkci@aalto.fi","Elsevier Ltd",01968904,,ECMAD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017480025

Design/methodology/approach: A socio-computational approach is adopted to model business transactions and supply chain formation in Marshallian industrial districts (IDs). An agent-based model is presented and used as a virtual lab to test the hypotheses between the firms’ behaviour and the emergence of structural properties at the system level. Findings: The simulation findings and their validation based on the comparison with a real world cluster show that the topological properties of the emerging network are influenced by the learning strategies and decision-making criteria firms use when choosing partners. With reference to the specific case of Marshallian IDs it is shown that inertial learning based on history and past collaboration represents in the long term a major impediment for the emergence of hubs and of a network topology that is more conducive to innovation and growth. Research limitations/implications: The paper offers an alternative view of entrepreneurial learning (EL) as opposed to the dominant view in which learning occurs as a result of exceptional circumstances (e.g. failure). The results presented in this work show that adaptive, situated, and day-by-day learning has a profound impact on the performance of entrepreneurial clusters. These results are encouraging to motivate additional research in areas such as in modelling learning or in the application of the proposed approach to the analysis of other types of entrepreneurial ecosystems, such as start-up networks and makers’ communities. Practical implications: Agent-based model can support policymakers in identifying situated factors that can be leveraged to produce changes at the macro-level through the identification of suitable incentives and social networks re-engineering. Originality/value: The paper presents a novel perspective on EL and offers evidence that micro-learning strategies adopted and developed in routine business transactions do have an impact on firms’ performances (survival and growth) as well as on systemic performances related to the creation and diffusion of innovation in firms networks. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agent-based modelling; Entrepreneurial learning; Innovation; Networks; Situated learning",,,"Ponsiglione, C.; Department of Industrial Engineering, Italy; email: ponsigli@unina.it","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",13552554,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017438183

Design/methodology/approach: The paper conceptualises the raw material consumption in a road project as a logistics network distribution problem. A linear programming (LP) formulation is constructed with appropriate decision variables by integrating the three stages of material movement. The series of LP scenarios are solved using an LP solver to decide the optimal movement of the aggregate to be consumed in different layers of road segments. Findings: The results obtained from the model show that planning material logistics of an entire road project using optimisation provides substantial saving in logistics costs than using common sense. Further, the magnitude of cost saving improves as the complexity of the model increases in term of enormous feasible options. Practical implications: The model shown in this paper may serve asabasis for planning the logistics of raw materials consumed in the road projects. The small improvement in material flows by optimising supply chain shows sensible cost benefit to the project manager and hence control and monitor the overall cost and activities of the project. The output of the model is also expected to help the project team as an input in the decision-making processes such as appropriate material sourcing contract, capacity assessment of material processing facility and transportation planning.

The model assessed biofuel production levels ranging from 1 to 150 PJ a−1 in the context of the existing Swedish forest industry. Biofuel was produced from forestry biomass using hydrothermal liquefaction and hydroprocessing. Simultaneous implementation of all cost reduction strategies yielded minimum biofuel production costs of 18.1–18.2 € GJ−1 at biofuel production levels between 10 and 75 PJ a−1. Limiting the economies of scale was shown to cause the largest cost increase (+0–12%, increasing with biofuel production level), followed by disabling integration benefits (+1–10%, decreasing with biofuel production level) and allowing unimodal truck transport only (+0–6%, increasing with biofuel production level). Distributed supply chain configurations were introduced once biomass supply became increasingly dispersed, but did not provide a significant cost benefit (&lt;1%). Disabling the benefits of integration favors large-scale centralized production, while intermodal transport networks positively affect the benefits of economies of scale. As biofuel production costs still exceeds the price of fossil transport fuels in Sweden after implementation of all cost reduction strategies, policy support and stimulation of further technological learning remains essential to achieve cost parity with fossil fuels for this feedstock/technology combination in this spatiotemporal context. © 2017 The Authors","Biofuel; Cost optimization; Distributed supply chain; Economies of scale; Integration; Intermodal transport","Biomass; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Forestry; Fossil fuels; Integration; Intermodal transportation; Supply chains; Truck transportation; Biofuel production; Biomass transports; Cost optimization; Economies of scale; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Intermodal transport; Supply chain configuration; Technological learning; Biofuels; biofuel; biomass; chemical alteration; cost analysis; distribution system; forestry; optimization; power generation; supply chain management; transportation economics; Sweden",,"de Jong, S.; Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, Heidelberglaan 2, Netherlands; email: s.a.dejong@uu.nl","Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016928741

This paper proposes that an organization’s orientation to open innovation is influenced by confirmation of previously held expectations of trust and commitment and level of perceived procedural justice in its open innovation partner. This paper also examines the effect of this orientation on the organization’s supply chain competence. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from a survey of 286 European firms, the study proposes and evaluates a structural equation model. Findings: The results show that a positive disconfirmation of trust (where perceived trust exceeds expectations) plays a crucial role in shaping organizations’ intentions to continue open innovation with their supply networks. These results show that disconfirmation is a good predictor of overall satisfaction with open innovation. This paper also confirms the positive effect of orientation to open innovation on supply chain competence. Finally, this paper obtained evidence for the positive effect of supply chain competence on firm performance. Originality/value: This study shows the importance of managing expectations in open innovation under the EDT.

Halal logistics is the key factor for this concept to be materialized. Therefore, it is crucial for halal logistics to be adopted by halal product producer to uphold the integrity of their product throughout the whole supply chain process. It's vey alarming that still huge number of Malaysian Halal small medium enterprises (SMEs) still not adopting halal logistics. Therefore, this shows the important of this study to be conducted to identify factors that influence the intention of SMEs to adopt halal logistics services (HLS). Three objectives were established. Firstly, investigate the current state of halal logistics adoption among SMEs. Hypotheses derived were based on seven factors acquired: familiarity with innovation, status characteristics and position in social network, benefits, geographical setting, societal culture and political condition. The second objective is to determine the significant factors that influence SMEs intention to adopt HLS. Lastly, final objective is to proposal of an adoption intention model able to significantly predict the adoption intention of HLS among Malaysian SMEs. With extensive data collection, this study has succeeded in stipulating evidence to show: (1) being in the same social group HLS players and being familiar on HLS will significantly influence SMEs to adopt HLS, (2) being positioned in the same group of HLS actors will result in higher accessibility to information on HLS and (3) understanding of HLS benefits versus cost and with good support from the government are the necessary enablers of adoption of HLS among Malaysian SMEs. This research has also contributed to future service innovation adoption researches by providing an instrument to measure intention adoption service innovation model. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Adoption; And diffusion of innovation theory; Halal logistics; Service innovation; SMEs",,,,"ExcelingTech",20513771,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016583782

We use multiple cases of premium FMCG and luxury companies, and a survey, built from the insights of the cases and answered by 23 luxury experts. Among the conclusions of the analysis is that, while the experts do not perceive premium FMCG as a threat to luxury brands, the latter can profit from the adoption of marketing and supply chain practices of premium FMCG to increase volume and reach new global markets. The marketing practices identified as more promising are channel separation and servitisation; while those of supply chain are network orchestration, Multi-level global organisation, visibility and cooperation.

Different to the three industrial revolutions that came before it, which were based on advances in technology, Industry 4.0 connects people and machines. It's the concept of a fully connected network of products, machines, people, business systems, the supply chain and the customer to enable a more autonomous, flexible and local manufacturing environment, ultimately making industry more competitive and customers getting improved service. First and foremost, Industry 4.0 will help grow manufacturers' profits, says Peter Colman, a partner at pricing strategists Simon-Kucher & Co. Many of the opportunities posed by Industry 4.0 have clear internal benefits, such as efficiencies and cost reduction. At a national level, Industry 4.0 implementation can bring growth, jobs and increased skills to a region, adds Gambica's Brambley. A more autonomous and self-organizing system allows for more flexibility in employee working patterns. With various societal shifts from an ageing population to childcare requirements and part-time working, this system could enable truly flexible working patterns to suit individuals and employers. For management, the benefits of Industry 4.0 are obvious.

Reduced empty truck trips contribute to sustainable transportation practices in the port territory. Design/methodology/approach: To contribute in the current body of the literature, through a comprehensive synthesis of the studies, this study examines many perspectives surrounding the empty truck trips at container terminals. Hence different, but relevant operational aspects of empty truck trips are explored. This study adopts a content analysis as the research methodology. Findings: Different perspectives, which are drawn from the reviewed literature, identify a research gap in published research in the area of transport collaboration (of supply chain collaboration) and coordination problems in hinterland transport chains (of maritime logistics), and the literature relating to backhauling (of vehicle routing problems with backhauls). To cover that research gap in the literature, this study attempts to highlight and synthesize the important empty-trips studies currently available into a coherent and understandable form. Practical implications: As an integral part of encouraging collaboration in the container transportation industry, this research may be effective in persuading port authorities to evaluate and to help transport managers to reply to specific enquiries of truck-sharing arrangements. Social implications: The utilization of available empty space of container trucks is a feasible option of increasing transport capacity and achieving sustainable transportation benefits. Originality/value: This paper provides a contemporary lens to view the relationship between empty trips and their applications in the carrier industry, in order to resolve the perceived issues of non-sustainable transportation and their implications for the society. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Carbon emission; Collaborative logistics network (CLN); Congestion; Supply chain collaboration (SCC); Transport collaboration",,,"Islam, S.; Department of Information Systems and Operations Management, New Zealand; email: samsul_islam_mis@hotmail.com","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14637154,,,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016254914

Recently CLSCs are gaining much attention because of the growing need for environmental conservation. A CLSC has a number of features that distinguish it from simply a forward supply chain. One of them is requiring a large fixed cost because of the many facilities required to collect and disassemble products at the end of their service life. Another is the additional costs required for expanding capacity to handle the increase in remanufactured products and parts. In this paper, the problems of redesigning an existing logistics network in the CLSC is addressed. Redesigning an existing logistics network considers both opening new facilities and closing existing facilities. To reduce the fixed cost of facilities, opening hybrid facilities and decisions regarding the volume of products at each facility are considered. For the forward supply chain, redesign problems have been well researched, but this study is the first effort to consider redesigning an existing logistics network while considering profit from the sale of land property as part of the actual data in a CLSC. A new mathematical programming model is proposed. To validate the network redesign model proposed, it is applied to a real industrial case. Through the case study, it was found that the model proposed addresses redesigning an existing CLSC logistics network corresponding to recycling and resource savings, and validates the extent of economic efficiency.","Closed loop supply chain; Facility location; Network design; Redesigning network","Cost accounting; Costs; Location; Mathematical programming; Plant shutdowns; Supply chains; Transportation; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); Environmental conservation; Facility locations; Mathematical programming models; Network design; Remanufactured products; Reverse supply chains; Logistics",,,"Japan Industrial Management Association",13422618,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016236081

[7]. In this problem requests arrive over time at the nodes of the tree, and each request specifies a deadline. A request is served by sending it to the root before its deadline at a cost equal to the weight of the path from the node in which it resides to the root. However, requests from different nodes can be aggregated, and served together, so as to save on cost. The cost of serving an aggregated set of requests is equal to the weight of the subtree spanning the nodes in which the requests reside. Thus, the problem is to find a competitive online aggregation algorithm that minimizes the total cost of the aggregated requests. This problem arises naturally in many scenarios, including multicasting, supply- chain management and sensor networks. It is also related to the well studied TCP-acknowledgement problem and the online joint replenishment problem.

Exploration and research of the mechanisms behind the failure of such systems have revealed that those capable of surviving are not robust, but resilient. This has spawned a stream of research on the resilience of different complex systems, from ecosystems, to the human body, to supply chains and communication networks. Supply networks are complex adaptive systems in which a subset of agents create flow and are required to deliver such flow to sink agents located at the other end of the network. Delivery of flow under pre-defined service conditions requires resilient design and operation protocols. In this article, a supply network formalism is introduced, and the concept and dimensions of resilience in supply networks, explored. Five core components of resilience are derived from reviewed definitions; two resilience dimensions, structure and control protocols, and two resilience levels, agent and network level, are characterized based on insights from articles in literature. Finally, emerging trends in resilience research as well as current research gaps are presented and future work directions outlined. © 2017","Collaborative Control Theory; Complex adaptive systems; Fault Tolerance by Teaming; Sustainability","Adaptive systems; Complex networks; Fault tolerance; Internet protocols; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Collaborative control; Complex adaptive systems; Control protocols; Core components; Emerging trends; Resilient design; Service conditions; Supply networks; Adaptive control systems",,"Reyes Levalle, R.email: rodrigo.reyeslevalle@gmail.com","Elsevier Ltd",13675788,,ARCOF,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015951330

More precisely two objectives viz. maximisation of overall quality and overall cost have been targeted. Considering both objectives, a multi-objective model has been formulated to integrate both tangible and intangible factors in the resource assignment problem of a product driven supply chain. Quality corresponding to each entity has been determined by applying a fuzzy-analytical hierarchical process approach. Minimisation of cost has been mathematically formulated with due consideration of various cost types. Proposed interactive adaptive multi-objective algorithm incorporates the decision maker's preference model to improve the accuracy of PSO in deciding the weight corresponding to each objective considered. Extensive experiments are performed on the underlying example, and computational results are reported and compared with the traditional particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm and genetic algorithm to support the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

These, however, sometimes fail to capture interdependency among communities for basic resources. This paper aims to propose a framework for characterizing vulnerability caused by interdependency by adapting a supply chain lens. Design/methodology/approach: The paper proposes a definition for “indirect vulnerability” that recognizes the transboundary and teleconnected nature of vulnerability arising from resource networks among cities and communities. A conceptual framework using a supply chain approach is presented for climate hazards in particular. This approach is then demonstrated through a rapid appraisal of the rice, energy and water supply chains and the waste management chains of Metro Manila. Findings: The application of the supply chain lens to assessing the indirect vulnerability of Metro Manila brings to fore issues extending beyond the decision-making boundaries of local government units. Addressing these will require vertical government coordination and horizontal inter-sectoral collaboration. Thus, this supply chain-based indirect vulnerability assessment can be complementary to traditional vulnerability assessments in providing a larger systems perspective. Originality/value: Innovative tools are needed to make community vulnerability assessments both holistic and tractable. Existing methods in the private sector can be adapted rather than reinventing the wheel. This supply chain framework can be a useful decision support and planning tool across governance levels to comprehensively address vulnerability. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Climate; Hazards; Supply chain; Sustainable cities; Vulnerability","climate effect; conceptual framework; decision making; hazard assessment; local government; private sector; supply chain management; sustainable development; vulnerability; waste management; National Capital Region; Philippines",,"Gotangco, C.K.; Department of Environmental Science, Philippines; email: kgotangco@ateneo.edu","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17568692,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015750234

The high complexity of modern designs, the constraint of time-to-market window, and the cost restriction of final product highly drive the horizontal integrated circuit design process. Practicing the horizontal integrated circuit design process, however, exposes a design to various types of malicious modifications that shall cause malfunctions under very rare circumstances.

Due to increasing demand for products, companies are trying to reduce the time-to-market (TTM) of ICs which, combined with the increased design complexity, boosts the intellectual property (IP) cores transaction market, and supports the growth of third-party design houses. Meanwhile, the exorbitant cost of in-house chip manufacturing and testing forces companies to outsource these services to foundries and third-party testing facilities. The use of third-party IPs and the outsourcing of fabrication and testing services have raised security concerns, thereby compelling companies to evaluate trustworthiness of their circuit designs. Many defense mechanisms have been proposed to protect IP/IC from reverse engineering, malicious tampering, piracy, counterfeiting, cloning, and overbuilding. In this chapter, we first illustrate different threats to an IP/IC as well as locations of possible adversaries in the supply chain. Subsequently, we discuss different protection methods for soft and firm IP cores. Among the two categories of protection methods, authentication, and prevention, we explain the prevention methods in greater details. We divide the prevention methods into combinational logic locking/encryption and finite state machine locking/encryption. Methods for protecting field-programmable gate array (FPGA) bitstreams are also included in the chapter. We then discuss various IP certification methods, which are used to ensure trustworthiness of IPs. Two main categories of formal methods are particularly elaborated within the scope of IP certification: theorem proving and equivalence checking. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Cesium compounds; Commerce; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Formal methods; Integrated circuit manufacture; Integrated circuits; Locks (fasteners); Network security; Product design; Reverse engineering; Supply chains; Certification methods; Chip-manufacturing; Combinational logic; Design complexity; Equivalence checking; Prevention methods; Protection methods; Security vulnerabilities; Integrated circuit design",,"Dutta, R.G.; University of Central FloridaUnited States; email: rajgautamdutta@knights.ucf.edu","Springer International Publishing",,9783319500577; 9783319500553,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014989454

However, increased solar PV modularity, reduced costs of both large utility-scale and smaller residential-scale systems, limited operation and maintenance costs, and conversion efficiencies independent of power capacities is expected to contribute to future broader scale PV adoption in both Africa and Latin America. Reported prices of PV systems vary widely and depend on many factors including system size, location, customer type, connection to an electricity grid and technical specifications. In this chapter it is shown that while PV capacity in Africa and Latin America is far below many other global regions, there are some countries experiencing rapid growth, and that other nations are investing in solar supply chain capabilities. The low cost of the simplest solar-powered lamps produce savings on kerosene that makes them a smart investment. Also, solar-powered pumps are cost-effective, reliable, and can save many hours of labour daily in rural off-grid areas, where water hauling is traditionally done by hand by women and children. These pumps are durable and immune to fuel shortages needed for conventional pumping systems, and they may cost less than diesel-powered generators in many African and Latin American areas. In conclusion, PV is growing rapdily in many African and Latin American countries because of its modularity and drop in costs, offering a hopeful future not only to many countries that need affordable electricity to grow, but also for small rural communities that would like to be connected to the global community. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Africa; Batteries; Electric grid; Electricity; Energy; Energy efficiency; Inverters; Latin America; Payback; Photovoltaics; PV modules; Semiconductors; Silicon; Solar cells; Solar irradiance","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electric inverters; Electric power transmission networks; Electricity; Energy efficiency; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Pumps; Semiconductor materials; Silicon; Solar cells; Solar energy; Supply chains; Africa; Electric grids; Energy; Latin America; Payback; Photovoltaics; PV modules; Solar irradiances; Solar power generation",,"Guerrero-Lemus, R.; Departmento de Física, Spain; email: rglemus@ull.es","Springer Verlag",21951284,,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014917776

First, the problem is formulated by mathematical programming and Lagrangian theory is used for adding the constraints to the objective function. Then, the equilibrium conditions are derived and the problem is formulated as a finite-dimensional variational inequality model.

Therefore, the models of RCSPs are more demanding, particularly when methods of operations research (OR) are used. By contrast, most resource-constrained scheduling problems can be easily modeled as instances of the constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and solved using constraint logic programming (CLP) or others methods. Moreover, CLP-based environments enable easy modeling of various types of constraints including logic constraints. In the CLP-based environment the problem definition is separated from the algorithms and methods used to solve the problem. Therefore, a hybrid approach to resource-constrained scheduling problems that combines an OR-based approach for problem solving and a CLP-based approach for problem modeling is proposed. To evaluate the efficiency and flexibility of this approach, illustrative examples of resource-constrained scheduling problems with logic constraints are implemented using hybrid CLP/MP approach. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Constraint programming; Knowledge-based approach; Mathematical programming; Resource-constrained scheduling problem","Computer circuits; Computer programming; Computer programming languages; Computer resource management; Constraint theory; Decision making; Knowledge based systems; Logic programming; Management science; Mathematical programming; Operations research; Problem solving; Project management; Scheduling; Software engineering; Supply chain management; Constrained resources; Constrained scheduling; Constraint Logic Programming; Constraint programming; Decision variables; Knowledge-based approach; Problem definition; Resource constrained scheduling; Constraint satisfaction problems",,"Wikarek, J.; Department of Information Systems, Poland; email: j.wikarek@tu.kielce.pl","Springer Verlag",21945357,,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014530330

The aims are to minimize the average tardiness to deliver products, total cost and transportation cost. In addition the developed model specifies the optimal locations for a new distribution center (DC), collection center and disposal center as well as the optimal allocation of customer zones to each DC. This model is solved in three stages: (1) a Jackson network determines the queuing parameters, (2) an Lp-metric approach makes the multi-objectives into a single objective, and (3) an efficient Lagrangian relaxation based on a sub-gradient approach solves the presented model.

In this regard, supply chain resilience (SCR) has received attention recently to cope with disruptions and improve competitiveness. This paper presents a novel methodology to measure resilience between different configurations of a supply chain network (SCN), based on a number of influential factors. For this reason, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is employed to identify the best-practice and less-performing SCN configurations among a group of alternatives. On this basis, the extent to which a current configuration can improve its resiliency is also measured. The methodology is applied to the case of E1, a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) company in Korea. Topological and operational measures were used as variables to assess resilience. The results suggest that the LPG supply chain in the case study requires an addition in the number and capacity of supply nodes in its network. © 2017 by the author.","Data envelopment analysis; Resiliency; Supply chain network; Vulnerability","competitiveness; data envelopment analysis; liquefied petroleum gas; network analysis; supply chain management; vulnerability; Korea",,"Chang, Y.-T.; Graduate School of Logistics, South Korea; email: ytchang@inha.ac.kr","MDPI",20711050,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013372015

The developed model was also used for determining the optimum numbers and allocations of farms and abattoirs that need to be established and the optimal quantity flow of livestock from farms to abattoirs and meat products from abattoirs to retailers. Design/methodology/approach: A multi-objective possibilistic programming model was formulated with a focus on minimizing the total cost of transportation, the number of transportation vehicles and the delivery time of meat products. Three sets of Pareto solutions were obtained using the three different solution methods. These methods are the LP-metrics method, the ɛ-constraint method and the weighted Tchebycheff method, respectively. The TOPSIS method was used for seeking a best Pareto solution as a trade-off decision when optimizing the three conflicting objectives. Findings: A case study was also applied for examining the effectiveness and applicability of the developed multi-objective model and the proposed solution methods. The research concludes that the ɛ-constraint method has the superiority over the other two proposed methods as it offers a better solution outcome. Research limitations/implications: This work addresses as interesting avenues for further research on exploring the delivery planner under different types of uncertainties and transportation means. Also, environmentalism has been increasingly becoming a significant global problem in the present century. Thus, the presented model could be extended to include the environmental aspects as an objective function. Practical implications: The developed design methodology can be utilized for food supply chain designers. Also, it could be applied to realistic problems in the field of supply chain management. Originality/value: The paper presents a methodology that can be used for tackling a multi-objective optimization problem of a meat supply chain network design. The proposed optimization method has the potential in solving the similar issue providing a compromising solution due to conflicting objectives in which each needs to be achieved toward an optimum outcome to survive in the competitive sector of food supply chains network. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Management; Meat; Multi-objective optimization; Possibilistic; Supply chain design","agricultural land; catering service; livestock; meat; model; slaughterhouse; uncertainty",,"Mohammed, A.; School of Engineering, United Kingdom; email: ahmed.mohammed@port.ac.uk","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",0007070X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012894488

Therefore, existing supply chains, structured in a global sourcing view, are highly vulnerable to perturbations resulting from a strong dependence on other network’s players, such as suppliers or logistics providers. In this complex and competitive context, properly assessing and managing risks connected to the different stages of the value chain, as well as external and not directly controllable risks, means being able to ensure continuity in supply. This paper focuses on the particular field of the fashion retail industry since its highly unpredictable demand and extremely short life cycle make it very important to analyse risks connected to the supply chain. The particular case we are referring to is represented by a fashion company that manages an extended network of wholesalers, direct operated stores, franchising mono-brand stores and factory outlet stores main aim of the presented work is to prioritise the list of identified risk factors by adopting the Analytic Network Process approach. This method is, in fact, more suitable for real complex problems that cannot be completely represented through a simple hierarchical structure. The obtained results show that supply chain efficiency, in terms of correct management of both material and informative flows, is considered the most crucial part also for a demand-driven supply chain as the fashion industry one which, in addition, is constantly seeking for customer tastes and always changing trends. © Research India Publications.","Analytic network process; Clothing industry; Fashion retail; Prioritization; Risk assessment; Risk management; Supply chain",,,,"Research India Publications",09734562,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011949640

A key research challenge was to extend traditional methods of SN mapping and value chain analysis that typically adopt a narrow focal firm perspective of a firm's supply network, to also include key institutional, and other industrial system actors that form part of the wider industrial ecosystem. An industrial ecosystem mapping methodology was therefore developed that integrates and extends value chain analysis with SN configuration mapping, applied to a broader industrial systems context.

Currently, these systems remain a relevant typology in the European Union (EU) member states of the Mediterranean areas, where it is often the only sustainable method for farmers due to the small size of agricultural holdings, their reduced capacity and readiness to invest and the low ratio between yield profits and irrigation costs. In the last several years, in response to European and national directives, surface irrigation has garnered increasing attention at the political and bureaucratic levels due to frequent criticisms of its postulated low efficiency and high water wastage. However, these systems commonly provide a number of ecosystem services and nature-based solutions that increase the positive externalities in different rural socio-ecological contexts and often have the potential to extend these services and provide solutions that are compatible with economical sustainability. This study aims to discuss the prospects for new practices and for the rehabilitation and modernization of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in EU Mediterranean areas to enhance water efficiency, thus gaining both economic advantages and environmental benefits. The difficulties, stimuli for improvements and peculiarities of the irrigation water management of four rural environments located in Italy, Spain and Portugal were analyzed and compared to the current state of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems with hypothetical future improvements achievable by innovative technologies and practices. In these different case studies, the current gravity-fed surface irrigation systems have an obsolete regulatory structure; water-use efficiency is not a driving criterion for the management of the conveyance and distribution canal network, and farmers are not yet adequately encouraged to adopt more efficient gravity-fed irrigation practices. A continuous knowledge exchange is thus necessary for the interaction of all irrigation water managers and farmers to improve their eco-efficiency and to preserve and promote their cultural heritage across the entire water supply and delivery chains. We argue that the best way forward will require precisely targeted rehabilitation measures of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems based on the integrated use of decision support services, gate automation, remote and feedback controls and real-time flow optimization. © 2017 by the authors.","Gravity-fed surface irrigation systems; Irrigated agriculture sustainability; Irrigation network; Irrigation policy; Water multi-functionality","Decision support systems; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Historic preservation; Irrigation; Knowledge management; Real time systems; Rural areas; Sustainable development; Water supply; Decision support services; Irrigated agriculture; Irrigation Networks; Irrigation water management; Multifunctionality; Rehabilitation measures; Surface irrigation; Water supply and deliveries; Water management; cultural heritage; decision support system; European Union; irrigation system; optimization; sustainability; typology; water management; water supply; water use efficiency; Italy; Portugal; Spain",,"Masseroni, D.; Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences (DiSAA), Via Celoria 2, Italy; email: daniele.masseroni@unimi.it","MDPI AG",20734441,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011295928

Much research and experiences investigating food waste causes and drivers focus on one specific segment of the food supply chain and limit the analysis to the situation of one or few countries, while the few studies of wider geographical scope also target other relevant and diversified objectives (e.g., food waste definition, quantification, environmental and economic impacts, and recommendations for interventions). This study, carried out by a network of European institutions involved in research and initiatives against food waste, focuses on the analysis of a broad area, Europe, through a wide and systematic literature review and consultation with stakeholders in international focus groups. The food supply chain was divided into seven segments and three main contexts were defined for the examination of food waste sources: Technological, Institutional (related to organisational factors, i.e., business management, economy, legislation, and policy), and Social (related to consumers' behaviours and lifestyles). Results suggest a wide and multifaceted problem, interconnected across all stages of the food supply chain, from primary production, to final consumption. Within each context, the identified drivers have been grouped according to the possibilities and the type of interventions for food waste reduction. A final cross-contextual prioritization distinguished food waste sources related to (A) inherent characteristics of food; (B) social and economic factors; (C) individual non-readily changeable behaviours; (D) other priorities targeted by private and public stakeholders; (E) diversified factors, such as mismanagement, inefficient legislation, lack of awareness or information; and sub-optimal use of available technologies, which could be more promptly changed. Such diversification of causes calls for specific monitoring systems, targeted policy measures, and actions of individual stakeholders at each stage of the food supply chain. © 2017 by the authors.","Food policy; Food sustainability; Food waste; Food waste drivers","economic analysis; food policy; food security; food supply; food waste; industrial production; literature review; monitoring system; organizational framework; prioritization; stakeholder; supply chain management; sustainability; Europe","FP7: 311972; BBSRC: BB/J004545/1","Canali, M.; Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Agroalimentari, Via Fanin 50, Italy; email: massimo.canali2@unibo.it","MDPI",20711050,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011045300

Resilience, the ability of the system to withstand disruption and return to a normal state quickly, has become a new challenge during the supply chain network design. This paper defines a new resilience measure as the ratio of the integral of the normalized system performance within its maximum allowable recovery time after the disruption to the integral of the performance in the normal state. Using the maximum allowable recovery time of the system as the time interval under consideration, this measure allows the resilience of different systems to be compared on the same relative scale, and be used under both scenarios that the system can or cannot restore in the given time. Two specific resilience measures, the resilience based on the amount of product delivered and the resilience based on the average delivery distance, are provided for supply chain networks.

This systematic review evaluates the potential impact of bioenergy buffers on multiple ecosystem services (ES) provision while describing key factors along the biomass supply chain. An Impact Assessment (IA) methodology was adopted to capture the direction and the level of confidence of impact on multiple ES including regulating (climate, water and biodiversity), supporting (soil health) and provisioning services (biomass and energy yield). The IA revealed that the implementation of bioenergy buffers on previous croplands rather than on grasslands sustains long-term provision of multiple ES such as climate, water quality and biodiversity regulation and soil health. Herbaceous buffers were found to be more effective than woody buffers in the provision of multiple ES. Knowledge gaps relative to climate and water quality regulation services were identified for the establishment phase of bioenergy buffers (0-3y). Regarding biomass logistics, the limited operating space for farm machinery was the main shortcoming when comparing bioenergy buffers to large-scale bioenergy plantations. The intra- and inter-farm spatial fragmentation of biomass supply areas may increase environmental costs related to biomass collection and transport operations, but this has not yet been fully tested. Establishing a network of bioenergy buffers increases landscape connectivity and the overall area of ES provision in the agricultural landscape. Payments for ES obtained from bioenergy buffers can ultimately improve the economics of sustainable bioenergy and help achieving environmental goals of EU policies on water, soil and biodiversity protection. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy buffers; Biomass supply chain; Ecosystem services; Energy crops; Impact matrix; Land use conflicts; Miscanthus; Poplar; Switchgrass; Willow","Agricultural machinery; Biodiversity; Crops; Ecosystems; Forestry; Land use; Soils; Supply chains; Water quality; Bio-energy; Biomass supply chain; Ecosystem services; Energy crops; Land use conflicts; Miscanthus; Poplar; Switchgrass; Willow; Biomass",,"Amaducci, S.; Department of Sustainable Crop Production, via Emilia Parmense 84, Italy; email: stefano.amaducci@unicatt.it","Elsevier Ltd",13640321,,RSERF,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010832438

While modern food production systems in the United States are very safe, systems are increasingly efficient, dynamic, integrated, tightly coupled, and complex. Food travels through domestic and international supply chains, is transported, processed, distributed, sent to retailers, and finally on to consumers. Insuring the safety and reliability of food production systems is a multistage process involving appropriate risk awareness, communication, mitigation resources, and appropriate response strategies.

CPD process improvements, in terms of complex engineering design and delivery, still lack a lot more variance to be addressed on the ""better, faster and cheaper"" paradigm for efficient communication and information exchange flow processes. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents employing social network theory analysis and statistical Pearson (r) correlation analysis in a triangulation approach to a proposed optimum conceptual information technology systems' architecture and a ""best practice"" information flow process toward enhancing an industrial sustainable competitive advantage. Closed-end questionnaires were used to collect data for the scale or level of communication network from a sample size of eight Ship Power supply chain network complex engineering design and delivery systems-design teams with at least five members from each team. Findings - Two extremely interesting findings and observations were identified from the analysis carried out (isolates and close-harmonic analysis) as well as the findings from the hypotheses' testing. These essential analyses of the engineering systems-design teams were conducted by using the triangulation or mixedmethod described in the abstract methodology identified above. Originality/value - Effective and efficient real-time communication is seen as the vehicle for effective organization management. Although there may be some studies on effective technical communication in organizational and enterprise supply chain management settings, this research identifies a new robust and extensive analysis and feasible solutions to most of the communication bottlenecks and inefficient socioindustrial information flow processes, which need enhancement for industrial competitive advantage.

Determination of coefficient (R2) was used to assess the adequacy of the regression model and R2for xylitol and biomass were 86.56% and 96.43% respectively. A multi layered feed forward neural network (ANN) of 5-10-2 topology has been developed to predict the xylitol production. Results showed that prediction accuracy of ANN was apparently higher when compared to regression model. Genetic algorithm (GA) was used to find the optimum parameters to enhance xylitol production. Optimization of fermentation parameters was carried out using hybrid regression GA and hybrid ANN GA with an optimum prediction error of 10% and 3.5% respectively.

While politicians seem unaware of this change, firms that once relied on local undocumented workers as a low-wage labor force feel it acutely. Such companies have increasingly applied to sponsor temporary migrants from abroad (sometimes called ""guest workers"") to fill empty jobs. In 2015, the number of migrant workers entering the United States on visas was nearly double that of undocumented arrivals-almost the inverse of just 10 years earlier. Yet notice of this dramatic shift, and examination of its implications for U.S. law and the regulation of employment in particular, has been absent from legal scholarship. This Article fills that gap, arguing that employers' recruitment of would-be migrants from other countries, unlike their use of undocumented workers already in the United States, creates a transnational network of labor intermediaries-the ""human supply chain""-whose operation undermines the rule of law in the workplace, benefitting U.S. companies by reducing labor costs while creating distributional harms for U.S. workers, and placing temporary migrant workers in situations of severe subordination. It identifies the human supply chain as a key structure of the global economy, a close analog to the more familiar product supply chains through which U.S. companies manufacture products abroad. The Article highlights a stark governance deficit with regard to human supply chains, analyzing the causes and harmful effects of an effectively unregulated world market for human labor. Drawing on the author's original research into innovative public, private, and hybrid approaches to the governance of human supply chains, the Article sets out and evaluates a range of potential interventions, ultimately proposing a new supply chain liability that realigns risk and responsibility for the harms that attend the global recruitment of low-wage workers.",,,,"Gordon, J.; Fordham University School of LawUnited States","University of Iowa",00210552,,,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010749149

The study focuses on the research agenda, the topics of interest, and the extent of research collaboration in logistics theory building and knowledge specific to Asia. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a mixed methods approach namely, content analysis drawn from the articles found in six well-recognized peer-reviewed logistics management related journals from 2003 to 2013, followed by social network analysis which is applied on the selected articles to provide a structure of the collaboration relationship. Findings - Initial findings suggest that there are some scholars in Asia who are instrumental in research collaboration and in building a body of knowledge on logistics management focused on Asia. More co-production of knowledge from deeper and tightly knit industry-academic collaboration is needed to progress this domain. Most of the published work use an empirical instrument drawn from the resource-based view to explore firm level supply chain collaboration and strategy. This suggests a positivist research tradition within logistics. There is a shortage of studies conducted on the supply chain as a network of enterprises. Research limitations/implications - The review of the articles is limited to six logistics specific journals and the authors only concentrate on logistics management research focused on Asia. The contributions from the other journals may have been missed. More collaboration at the institutional, national, and international levels is called for especially on cross-collaboration between practice and theory.

At a suitable price and consideration of all affecting criteria, anything can be outsourced. Any exporter needs to find a smart balance of what to perform in-house and what to hire outside providers to do (i.e., increase verticals and reduce horizontal supply chain operations). Thus, the demand of 3PL provider has become an important issue for organisations seeking quality customer service and cost reduction. The current research presents an integrated data envelopment analysis (DEA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) methodology for the evaluation and selection of 3PL providers. DEA is employed to identify the maximally efficient 3PL and to eliminate the unsuitable ones; and, ANN to rank and make the final selection. The proposed method enables decision makers to better understand the complete evaluation and selection process of 3PL selection. Furthermore, this approach provides a more accurate, effective, and systematic decision support tool for 3PL selection. Finally, an actual industrial application is presented to demonstrate the proposed method.

The integrated model addressed in this study simultaneously determines three types of decisions: (1) facility location (optimal number, location, and size of DCs); (2) allocation (assignment of suppliers to located DCs and retailers to located DCs, and corresponding optimal transport mode choices); and (3) inventory control decisions on order quantities, reorder points, and amount of safety stock at each retailer and opened DC. A mixed-integer programming model is presented, which considers the carbon emission taxes, multiple transport modes, stochastic demand, and replenishment lead time. The goal is to minimize the total cost, which covers the fixed costs of logistics facilities, inventory, transportation, and CO2 emission tax charges. The aforementioned optimal model was solved using commercial software LINGO 11. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the applications of the proposed model. The findings show that carbon emission taxes can significantly affect the supply chain structure, inventory level, and carbon emission reduction levels. The delay rate directly affects the replenishment decision of a retailer. © 2017 Li et al.

Forest biomass as a feedstock is non-uniform, voluminous and high in moisture content (MC). This leads to inefficiencies during transportation and energy conversion process, posing a challenge for supply chains to remain profitable. The problem is exacerbated by seasonality in both supply and demand. A terminal in the biomass feedstock supply chain could help overcome these challenges, but adds a significant cost. A novel multi-period mixed-integer programming (MIP) model capable of taking into consideration biomass quality, seasonality, and weather related supply restrictions was developed. The model was applied in a case study to assess the benefits of incorporating a terminal in the supply chain. It was demonstrated that a terminal allowed delivery of feedstock 4–11% lower in MC, while reducing procurement costs by 11–32%. The benefits reported are sensitive to transportation and operating costs. The proposed model will serve as a valuable tool for practitioners to design supply chains, and assess the feasibility of using forest biomass for sustainable biofuels production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Forest biomass; Log yard; Moisture; Supply chain; Terminal; Vendor managed inventory","Biofuels; Costs; Energy conversion; Feedstocks; Forestry; Integer programming; Moisture; Operating costs; Supply chains; Terminals (electric); Bio-energy; Biofuels production; Forest biomass; Log yard; Mixed integer programming model; Supply chain modeling; Supply chain network; Vendor managed Inventory; Biomass; bioenergy; biofuel; biomass; energy efficiency; feasibility study; forest ecosystem; moisture content; numerical model; seasonality",,"Gautam, S.; Département des Sciences du bois et de la forêt, Canada; email: shuva-hari.gautam.1@ulaval.ca","Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009774239

DC and operations and management (OM) are both addressed. The problem owners are those in roles and organisations responsible for integrating DC with OM. The purpose of this paper is to show the extent of integration between actors along the project lifecycle. Relationally integrated value networks (RIVANS) provide the conceptual lens for the analysis. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed method approach was used. A questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews were employed. Findings: There is a lack of engagement between DC and OM. The trend is moving counter to integration. BIM is not found to be a technical solution. Research limitations/implications: The mixed method helps extend the RIVANS perspective. Further research to understand and support integration is needed, especially qualitative research to provide greater granular understanding. Practical implications: The identified trend away from integration poses management challenges in delivery and for sustainability in use. Supply chains engage specialists, yet internal and inter-organisational collaboration require management attention to value creation. This includes the DC-OM interface. Both sides can benefit from increased engagement. Social implications: Infrastructure and property provision will continue to fall short of user and environmental functionality without improved integration.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use long-term time series of secondary data to assemble a “basket” of key indicators that are relevant to the business context within which global supply chains operate. The authors also report on five years of feedback gained from presentations of the SCVI to scholars and practitioners. Findings: Volatility has reduced from record levels experienced during the global financial crises, yet remains at levels considerably higher than prior to the crisis, with no sign of a return to the more stable conditions that prevailed when many current supply chain networks were designed. Research limitations/implications: The authors reaffirm that new mental models are needed which embrace volatility as a factor in supply chain design, rather than seek to eradicate it in supply chain operations. Traditional static “network optimisation” based on a simple definition of low unit cost seems no longer appropriate under conditions of persistent volatility. Practical implications: The authors provide a conceptual link of volatility, risk and cost in the supply chain, and outline how firms can develop a supply chain strategy by managing their exposure to volatility. Originality/value: The authors challenge the common assumption that volatility invariably leads to risk and higher cost in the supply chain. Instead the authors argue that the supply chain structure can mitigate the exposure to supply chain risk. The authors introduce the concepts of recovery and resilience cost within a framework designed to help firms manage volatility-induced risk by minimising the adverse cost implications of volatility in their supply chains. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Flexibility; Risk; Supply chain design; Uncertainty; Volatility",,,"Christopher, M.; School of Management, United Kingdom; email: m.g.christopher@cranfield.ac.uk","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09600035,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009471430

Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a design science approach to develop a procedural model for identifying SCSR as a new artifact. A small-scale field-testing study in a food supply chain of a Swiss retail firm demonstrates its applicability and pragmatic validity. Findings: When stakeholder knowledge external to the supply chain is regarded as a valuable resource, a generic understanding of a buying firm’s supply chain suffices to identify SCSR hotspots without creating complexity for the SCSR management. Research limitations/implications: The paper contributes to the study of SCSR by identifying mechanisms buying firms can employ to identify SCSR hotspots and fostering the nascent understanding of responsibility attribution by stakeholders. Moreover, the emerging theory of the supply chain is enriched by paving a way to extend the supply chain visibility boundary. The procedural model is presumably most useful in contexts of elevated stakeholder pressure and low supply chain visibility. Future research should seek to validate and improve the effectiveness of the newly designed artifact. Practical implications: The procedural model is directly applicable in corporate practice to the identification of SCSR. Moreover, its application fosters the understanding of a firm’s supply chain and its stakeholder network. Originality/value: SCSR is an increasingly important phenomenon in corporate practice that has received only scarce research attention. The design science approach represents a valuable means for generating theoretical insights and emergent solutions to the real-world problem of SCSR identification. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Design science; Risk management; Stakeholder management; Supply chain visibility; Sustainability",,,"Busse, C.; Department of Management, Switzerland; email: cbusse@ethz.ch","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09600035,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009446793

Critical decisions include facility location, inventory, and transportation issues. This study proposes that with a dual-channel supply chain network design model, the traditional location-inventory problem should be extended to consider the vast amount of online customers at the strategic level, since the problem usually involves multiple and conflicting objectives. Therefore, a multi-objective dual-channel supply chain network model involving three conflicting objectives is initially proposed to allow a comprehensive trade-off evaluation. In addition to the typical costs associated with facility operation and transportation, we explicitly consider the pivotal online customer service rate between the distribution centers (DCs) and their assigned customers. This study proposes a heuristic solution scheme to resolve this multi-objective programming problem, by integrating genetic algorithms, a clustering analysis, a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), and a Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS).

However, the downstream bottleneck restricting isoprene biosynthesis capacity caused by the weak expression and low activity of plant isoprene synthase (ISPS) under microbial fermentation conditions remains to be alleviated. Here, based on a previously constructed Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain with enhanced precursor supply, we strengthened the downstream pathway through increasing both the expression and activity of ISPS to further improve isoprene production. Firstly, a two-level expression enhancement system was developed for the PGAL1-controlled ISPS by overexpression of GAL 4. Meanwhile, the native GAL1/7/10 promoters were deleted to avoid competition for the transcriptional activator Gal4p, and GAL80 was disrupted to eliminate the dependency of gene expression on galactose induction. The IspS expression was obviously elevated upon enhanced Gal4p supply, and the isoprene production was improved from 6.0 mg/L to 23.6 mg/L in sealed-vial cultures with sucrose as carbon source. Subsequently, a novel high-throughput screening method was developed based on precursor toxicity and used for ISPS directed evolution towards enhanced catalytic activity. Combinatorial mutagenesis of the resulting ISPS mutants generated the best mutant ISPSM4, introduction of which into the GAL4-overexpressing strain YXM29 achieved 50.2 mg/L of isoprene in sealed vials, and the isoprene production reached 640 mg/L and 3.7 g/L in aerobic batch and fed-batch fermentations, respectively. These results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed combinatorial engineering strategy in isoprene biosynthesis, which might also be feasible and instructive for biotechnological production of other valuable chemicals. © 2016 International Metabolic Engineering Society","Directed evolution; GAL4 regulation; Isoprene; Isoprene synthase; Saccharomyces cerevisiae","Biochemistry; Biosynthesis; Carbon; Catalyst activity; Fermentation; Gene expression; Yeast; Biotechnological production; Directed evolution; Enhanced catalytic activity; GAL4 regulation; High throughput screening methods; Isoprene synthase; Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains; Transcriptional activators; Isoprene; galactose; isoprene; isoprene synthase; protein Gal4p; sucrose; synthetase; transcription factor; unclassified drug; 1,3 butadiene derivative; DNA binding protein; GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae; GAL80 protein, S cerevisiae; hemiterpene; isoprene; isoprene synthase; pentane; repressor protein; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; transcription factor; transferase; Article; batch fermentation; biotechnological production; carbon source; catalysis; combinatorial chemistry; fed batch fermentation; fungal gene; fungal strain; GAL80 gene; gene expression system; high throughput screening; IspS gene; metabolic engineering; mutagenesis; nonhuman; precursor; priority journal; promoter region; real time polymerase chain reaction; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; biosynthesis; directed molecular evolution; gene expression regulation; genetic enhancement; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; physiology; procedures; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; upregulation; Alkyl and Aryl Transferases; Biosynthetic Pathways; Butadienes; Directed Molecular Evolution; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Genetic Enhancement; Hemiterpenes; Metabolic Engineering; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Pentanes; Repressor Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Transcription Factors; Up-Regulation","NSFC: 21406196, 21576234; ZJNSF: LQ14B060005","Ye, L.; Institute of Bioengineering, China; email: yelidan@zju.edu.cn","Academic Press Inc.",10967176,,MEENF,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008643956

The original large-scale power system is firstly divided into several small-scale subsystems, in which each subsystem is regarded as an agent, such that a decentralized OCECF can be achieved via a Nash game among all the agents. Then, a knowledge matrix associated with a state-action chain is presented for knowledge storing of the previous optimization tasks, which can be updated by a continuous interaction with the external environment. Furthermore, an extreme learning machine is adopted for an efficient transfer learning, such that the convergence rate of a new task can be dramatically accelerated by properly exploiting the prior knowledge of the source tasks. EMO has been thoroughly evaluated for the decentralized OCECF on IEEE 57-bus system, IEEE 300-bus system, and a practical Shenzhen power grid of southern China.

In this respect, utilization of second-generation biodiesel from non-edible feedstocks has been attracted many interests in recent years. To accelerate transition towards large-scale and economic viable biofuels, systematic design and optimization of entire biofuel supply chains is crucial. In this paper, firstly the presented works for biofuel supply chains optimization are systematically reviewed and categorized. Secondly, a multi-period and multi-product biodiesel supply chain network design model is developed. The proposed model is capable to determine the optimum numbers, locations, capacity of facilities, suitable transportation modes, appropriate technology at bio-refinery, material flow, and production planning in different periods. The proposed model is applied in a real case in Iran. We consider Jatropha seeds and waste cooking oil as non-edible feedstocks for second-generation biodiesel production in the studied case.

This paper uses firm embeddedness to examine food retailer adaptation within a changing home market, focusing on Wal-Mart’s efforts to implement local produce sourcing in the U.S. Growing consumer interest in local food has sufficiently shifted the competitive landscape within the U.S. market that Wal-Mart and other food retailers have sought to incorporate local produce into their operations. This paper asks whether Wal-Mart’s core lean retailing strategy facilitates or impedes such efforts to localize its U.S. produce supply chains. Qualitative field research conducted in 2011–2012 in one U.S. region centered on semi-structured interviews with 27 fresh fruit and vegetable producers involved in Wal-Mart’s local produce supply chains and 20 representatives of organizations facilitating commercial relationships between local growers and Wal-Mart. We find that the lean retailing model developed by Wal-Mart in response to historical circumstances in U.S. retailing and central to its present global retail dominance also limits Wal-Mart’s ability to engage in the bottom-up learning and adaptation to local contexts necessary for adjusting to the new competitive environment of local food. Wal-Mart’s centralized management and distribution systems, practices of cutting out intermediaries, and emphasis on standardization all presented some barriers to establishing the territorial and network embeddedness that could facilitate adaptation. However, we conclude that rather than simply failing to adapt to the challenges of localization, Wal-Mart applied a hybrid strategy in its local produce sourcing program. This hybrid strategy combined lean retailing—Wal-Mart’s traditional basis of competition—with selected, rather than comprehensive aspects of localization. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Competitive environment; firm embeddedness; food retailer; food systems; lean retailing; local food; localization; standardization; supply chain","competitiveness; food market; local economy; retailing; strategic approach; supply chain management; United States","NSF: 1103180; NIFA: 2011-67011-30760; CAS","Bloom, J.D.; North Carolina State University, Campus Box 7606, United States; email: jdbloom@ncsu.edu","SAGE Publications Ltd",0308518X,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006371820

We show that over that time period the international division of labor and trade patterns are tightly linked to the price of oil. We observe a remarkably high negative correlation (−0.85) between the oil price and the share of cyclical value, i.e. the share of value embodied in raw materials and intermediate products that are conserved across direct and indirect relationships. We demonstrate that this correlation does not depend on the balance of payments nor on the nominal value of trade or trade agreements; it is instead linked to the way Global Value Chains (GVCs) shape global trade. The cycling indexes show two majors structural breaks in terms of distance and length of GVCs, hinting at two phases of the recent globalization dynamics, sustained by two major transport modes. Our study suggests that transport played an important structural role in shaping GVCs, unveiling the deep, long-term impact of energy costs on the structure and connectivity of the global economy. In more theoretical term, our results indicate that the production structure could be approached as an energy system, forged by the efficiency in the transport sector. Understanding the role of oil in a globalized economy is of paramount importance for decoupling of economic growth from energy growth and transitioning toward a de-carbonized economy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Global supply chains; Globalization; Markov chain analysis; Network analysis; Oil price","Crude oil; Economic analysis; Electric network analysis; International trade; Markov processes; Supply chains; Global supply chain; Global value chain; Globalization; Intermediate product; Markov chain analysis; Negative correlation; Oil Prices; Production structures; Costs; balance of payments; commodity price; crude oil; economic growth; energy efficiency; global economy; globalization; labor division; Markov chain; supply chain management; trade agreement",,"Picciolo, F.; Department of Biotechnology, Italy; email: picciolo.fr@gmail.com","Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006253046

The British rail network has seen considerable growth of both freight and passenger activity in the last 20 years, leading to concerns about its capacity to absorb continued growth. A number of infrastructure initiatives focused on increasing capacity and reducing conflicts have been implemented. This includes the North Doncaster Chord, opened in June 2014 primarily to provide a more direct route from the port of Immingham to the major Aire Valley power stations (i.e. Drax, Eggborough and Ferrybridge). The paper analyses the freight impacts of the new chord, focusing on three key operational measures (i.e. train routing, scheduled journey times and train punctuality) during 10-week survey periods before and after the opening of the chord. The analysis is based on real-time data relating to coal and biomass trains operating between Immingham and the three power stations. This is a novel approach as the data have been made publicly available only recently, allowing a detailed investigation of the flows on this corridor at a highly disaggregated level. The use of this empirical method to assess the detailed rail freight operational impacts is an important element in the process of evaluating the effects of network enhancement. The results demonstrate improvements in each of the three operational measures, but also reveal a situation considerably more complex than that suggested by the published material relating to the justification for this new infrastructure. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Disaggregated freight data; Rail freight; Transport efficiency; Transport infrastructure; United Kingdom","freight transport; public transport; railway transport; traffic management; train; transportation infrastructure; United Kingdom",,,"Elsevier Ltd",09666923,,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006172926

Product recovery which comprises recycling, remanufacturing, repairing and disposing requires an efficient reverse logistic network. Among used products, waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) has become a major problem for developing countries due to its harmful effects. WEEE contains hazardous materials that may have an impact on both environment and human health if it is properly managed. On the contrary, valuable materials can be extracted if it is controlled properly. Therefore, decision makers should give consideration to design an efficient reverse logistic network to manage WEEE. In this paper, a mathematical model of two-stage RL network has been developed based on sustainable development objectives in which economic, environmental and social objectives are considered simultaneously. A multi objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is developed to determine the best locations of collection centres and recycling plants. In result, the decision makers can make the trade-off between environmental issues and economic and social impacts.

To develop the solution method, an accelerated sample average approximation approach is combined with an accelerated Benders’ decomposition algorithm. The accelerated sample average approximation approach improves the main structure of the original technique through the reduction in the number of mixed integer programming problems that need to be solved. Furthermore, the recently accelerated Benders’ decomposition approach is utilized to expedite the solution time of the mixed integer programming problems. In order to examine the performance of the proposed solution method, the computational experiments are performed on developed stochastic supply chain network design problems. The computational results show that the accelerated solution method solves these problems efficiently.

Comminution and transport are two of the major contributors to the total costs in the forest fuel supply system. In order to fully utilise truck payloads and reduce transport costs, logging residues are usually chipped at the landing. For the chipping contractor, it is important to maximise the proportion of effective work time in relation to scheduled work time. Currently it is not uncommon that effective work time is less than 50 per cent of scheduled work time, due to chip transports using the chipper, waiting for chip trucks, and other delays. Increased chipper utilisation requires greater coordination between the chipper and the chip trucks transporting the produced chips to the customer. Supply systems have been simulated to examine how transport distance, number of trucks, shift scheduling and chip buffers affect the system costs for a high-performance chipper system. System costs and machine utilisation vary greatly, depending on system configuration. It is always beneficial to have six containers in the buffer on the landing rather than three, and trucks should begin their shifts at one-hour intervals. To maximise chipper use and minimise system costs, four container trucks are needed if the transport distance exceeds 50 km. However, the large seasonal fluctuations in demand for biomass chips makes it hard to fully utilise the potential of the system over the whole year. The study concludes that it is important to regard chipping and chip transport as one operation, not two separate ones, as they are so dependent on each other. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Comminution; Forest fuel; Supply chain; Transport","Automobiles; Biomass; Comminution; Containers; Cost reduction; Costs; Forestry; Landing; Supply chains; Truck transportation; Trucks; Factors affecting productivity; Forest fuel; Forest fuel supply; Seasonal fluctuations; Shift scheduling; System configurations; Transport; Transport distances; Cost benefit analysis; biomass; communication network; cost analysis; energy market; factor analysis; forest resource; performance assessment; plant residue; price dynamics; profitability; seasonal variation; supply chain management; transport vehicle","","Eliasson, L.; Skogforsk, Uppsala Science Park, Sweden; email: Lars.Eliasson@skogforsk.se","Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84999006684

One of the goals of this undertaking is to distribute products from plants to customers in a way that meets customer's needs while minimizing transportation cost. The distribution center problem in this work is represented by a bi-level programming model where the upper- and lower- parts are to find the minimum transportation cost of shipping products from plants to DCs and from DCs to customers, respectively. This work presents four algorithms to find an optimum balance between the objective function values of the two levels. The computational experiments are constructed to test the performances of all proposed algorithms. In less than 10 min, the proposed algorithms can find solution for a problem with as many as 300 plants, 1000 DCs and 3500 customers (300 × 1000 × 3500), while the optimal solution for the bi-level problem can be found via CONOPT solver for problem with up to (70 × 200 × 500) in 90 min. Simulation results show less than 6% optimality gaps of the bi-level problem via the proposed algorithms and less than 7% gaps of the single level problem. In addition, all presented algorithms are used to find solutions for the network representing the sugarcane management system of Lampang and the network for 10 provinces, including Lampang, in Northern Thailand. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can reduce the total transportation cost of the bi-level programming problem where the steepest descent algorithm developed is better than the other alternatives. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bi-level programming; Distribution center; Sugarcane management","Costs; Optimization; Sales; Supply chains; Warehouses; Bi-level programming; Bilevel programming models; Computational experiment; Distribution centers; Objective function values; Steepest descent algorithm; Sugarcane managements; Supply chain network; Problem solving",,"Likasiri, C.; Chiang Mai University, 239 HuayKaew Road, Suthep, Mueng, Thailand; email: Chulin.l@cmu.ac.th","Elsevier Ltd",03608352,,CINDD,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996534001

This movement has successfully developed non-state market-driven governance tools to catalyse improvements in fisheries governance. Non-state market-driven governance is often discussed in the context of certification programs such as the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), but this is just one facet of a diversified, multi-pronged governance regime that has been created to improve the sustainability of fisheries; others include fisheries improvement projects, sustainable seafood sourcing policies, and traceability schemes. Movement actors use these non-state market-driven governance tools to reform fisheries governance through the supply chain. While recognition exists in the literature of the continued importance of fisheries governance reform, the complementary nature and the need for improved coordination between public governance and non-state market-driven governance efforts is insufficiently explored. Few actors in either sector understand fully the work of the other.

Thus, the purpose of this study is to develop performance measurement criteria and metrics that is designed to evaluate the efficiency of desalination supply chain concerning the economic and environmental factors. Different desalination and supply chain performance measures related to economic, and environmental perspective have been reviewed. The performance measures and metrics have been further refined by a panel of experts using Delphi technique. By adopting the analytic hierarchy process technique, a weight factor has been assigned to each perspective and metric according to its significant in desalination supply chain. It is believed that both academics and practitioners would benefit from the framework developed. Finally, it must be realized that desalination is one part of the solution.

The proposed model minimizes the total costs of biodiesel supply chain from feedstock supply centers to customer centers besides minimizing the environmental impact (EI) of all involved processes under a well-to-wheel perspective. Non-edible feedstocks are considered for biodiesel production. Variable cultivation cost of non-edible feedstock is assumed to be non-linear and dependent upon the amount of cultivated area. New formulation of possibilistic programming method is developed which is able to minimize the total mean and risk values of problems with possibilistic-based uncertainty. To solve the proposed multi-objective model, a hybrid solution approach based on flexible lexicographic and augmented ɛ-constraint methods is proposed which is capable to find appropriate efficient solutions from the Pareto-optimal set. The performance of the proposed possibilistic programming method as well as the developed solution approach are evaluated and validated through conducting a real case study in Iran.

For decades, the main focus of SCM has been on efficient ways of managing the flows through complex networks of supplier, producers and customers. More recently, and as a result of the exponential increase of energy and materials consumption rates of energy and materials, sustainable development arise as an urgent issue and new approaches to SCM are required to incorporate environmental and economic concerns in the design of supply chains. In this paper, a new green supply chain (GSC) design approach has been proposed to deal with the trade-offs between environmental and financial issues in order to reduce negative impacts on the environment caused by the increasing levels of industrialization. The new approach incorporates a closed loop network to accommodate the reprocessing paradigm of disposal products and a multi-objective optimization mathematical model to minimize overall costs and carbon dioxide emissions when setting the supply chain. Optimization process is performed using three scalarization approaches, namely weighted sum method, weighted Tchebycheff and augmented weighted Tchebycheff. Computational results are analyzed to identify the advantages and drawbacks of each approach.

Drawing on 717 suppliers and their major customer networks from the Compustat database, the study shows that customer concentration and interconnection negatively affect the supplier's ROAt+1 and ROSt+1, whereas mutual dependence enhances them and reduces the negative impact of customer concentration on the supplier's profitability.

The SSCN contains a manufacturer, directly connected to several distribution centres DC, which are directly connected to one or more customers C. Each direct link between any two elements of Secure Supply Chain Network is allocated a transportation cost. Within the proposed model, the manufacturer produces a single product type; each distribution centre has a fixed capacity and a security rank.

Firms achieve competitive advantages in business management through eco-innovation, and industrial symbiosis makes a major contribution to achieving win-win status in supply-chain networks. However, although many attributes have been addressed in previous studies, the role of eco-innovation remains unclear in the extended industrial symbiosis literature. This study attempts to identify the key eco-innovation attributes for enhancing industrial symbiosis performance. These attributes can serve as a reference for firms involved in promoting operational activities. This study collected information from the textile industry in Vietnam. Next, the fuzzy Delphi method was employed to filter the attributes with higher weights, factor analysis was used to compose the hierarchical structure, fuzzy importance-performance analysis was applied to identify the key attributes, and a supermatrix was converged into attribute weight ranking. The fuzzy Delphi method resulted in a set of criteria, the factor analysis resulted in four aspects (environmental sustainability, collaboration, regulation and perception, and waste-management synergies), and 18 attributes remained in the hierarchical structure. The results of the importance-performance analysis and the converged supermatrix weight ranking in the hierarchical structure are presented. The results show that the regulation and perception aspect and the waste-management synergies aspect have the highest weights. Moreover, firms should implement action plans that include stakeholder and community involvement, customer perceptions, shared waste transport, and joint external-agent waste management. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Converged supermatrix; Eco-innovation; Fuzzy Delphi method; Hierarchical structure; Importance-performance analysis; Industrial symbiosis","Competition; Decision making; Environmental regulations; Factor analysis; Fuzzy filters; Innovation; Multivariant analysis; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Textile industry; Eco-innovation; Fuzzy Delphi Method; Hierarchical structures; Importance-performance analysis; Industrial symbiosis; Supermatrix; Waste management",,"Tseng, M.-L.; Department of Business Administration, Taiwan; email: tsengminglang@gmail.com","Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991233467

The purpose of this study was to investigate the co-occurrence of potentially pathogenic FLA and their associated bacteria in hospital water networks in Johannesburg, South Africa. A total of 178 water (n = 95) and swab (n = 83) samples were collected from two hospital water distribution systems. FLA were isolated using the amoebal enrichment technique and identified using PCR and 18S rDNA sequencing. Amoebae potentially containing intra-amoebal bacteria were lysed and cultured on blood agar plates. Bacterial isolates were characterized using the VITEK®2 compact System. Free-living amoebae were isolated from 77 (43.3 %) of the samples. Using microscopy, PCR and 18S rRNA sequencing, Acanthamoeba spp. (T3 and T20 genotypes), Vermamoeba vermiformis and Naegleria gruberi specie were identified. The Acanthamoeba T3 and T20 genotypes have been implicated in eye and central nervous system infections.

The exchange of goods and services, from different supply points to distinct destinations scattered along a given geographical area, requires the management of stocks and vehicles fleets in order to minimize costs while maintaining good quality services. Even if the operating conditions remain constant over a given time horizon, managing a supply chain is a very complex task. Its complexity increases exponentially with both the number of network nodes and the dynamical operational changes. Moreover, the management system must be adaptive in order to easily cope with several disturbances such as machinery and vehicles breakdowns or changes in demand. This work proposes the use of a model predictive control paradigm in order to tackle the above referred issues.

Uncertainties in yield, quality, price, and infrastructure in one part of the supply chain can affect the whole chain. To ensure a sustainable seaweed industry, an appropriate supply chain risk management (SCRM) is needed. There are four critical steps in SCRM: identifying seaweed supply chains, identifying and categorizing risks, assessing risks, and mitigating risks. To identify seaweed supply chains, we conducted field research, in-depth interviews, and literature studies. The field survey was conducted in the Provinces of South Sulawesi, West Java, East Java, Banten, and West Nusa Tenggara. The seaweed supply chains were modeled by the software Umberto to get a better understanding of material and energy flows between the key members. To identify and categorize the risks, we started with the risks mentioned in the existing literature works, and then applied the Delphi method to analyze the potential risk sources, their causes, and their impacts. To assess risks, we used a semiquantitative approach through the face-to-face interviews to generate a risk map showing the likelihood, and impact of adverse events. Afterward, the risk intensity was categorized based on the value of the responses and classified into five categories: negligible, marginal, critical, most critical, and catastrophic risks. The mitigation strategies considered sustainability (environment, economy, and social) and risks criteria. Multi-criteria decision analysis was used to evaluate these strategies. © 2016, The Author(s).","Marine biomass resources; MCDA; Mitigation strategies; Seaweed supply chain risks; Supply chain risk management","Maps; Risk assessment; Seaweed; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Marine biomass; MCDA; Mitigation strategy; Supply chain risk; Supply chain risk management; Risk management",,"Mulyati, H.; Department of Management, Jl.

To address this need, we develop performance evaluation models of SCNs that explicitly consider production capacity, inventory related decisions, variability, transit delays and inventory information sharing in a unified manner. We employ a two-echelon SCN configuration with two retail stores and two production facilities as a test bed. The retail stores have inventory information from the production facilities. We model three levels of inventory information sharing in our study; the information shared ranges from the stock-out information at the lowest level to inventory and backorder level information at the highest level. We develop analytical models first for Poisson arrivals and exponential processing times under all levels of inventory information sharing. We extend these models to general inter-arrival and processing time distributions and subsequently include transit delays between the production facilities and the retail stores. We demonstrate the performance prediction capability of the analytical models developed via extensive numerical experimentation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Base-stock policy; Inventory information sharing; Queueing models; Supply chain network","Analytical models; Costs; Information analysis; Information management; Queueing theory; Retail stores; Sales; Supply chains; Analytical performance evaluations; Base stock policy; Inventory information; Numerical experimentations; Performance evaluation models; Queueing model; Supply chain network; Two-echelon supply chain; Information dissemination",,"Srivathsan, S.; School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Singapore; email: ssandeep@ntu.edu.sg","Elsevier Ltd",03050548,,CMORA,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983461841

The pivotal role of taking uncertainty and risk into account in closed-loop supply chain networks has induced numerous researchers and practitioners to develop appropriate decision making tools to cope with these issues in such networks. To design a supply chain regarding environmental impacts under uncertainty of the input data and to cope with the operational risks, this paper proposes a multi objective possibilistic optimization model. The proposed model minimizes traditional costs such as cost of products shipment, purchasing machines and so on, as well as minimizing the environmental impact, and as a results strikes a balance between the two objective functions. Furthermore, in order to solve the proposed multi objective fuzzy mathematical programming model, an interactive fuzzy solution approach is applied. Numerical experiments are used to prove the applicability and feasibility of the developed possibilistic programming model and the usefulness of the applied hybrid solution approach. © 2017 Growing Science Ltd.

While CI and AI partly overlap, the methods applied in CI benefit from nature-inspired strategies and implement them as computational algorithms. Mathematical optimization is shortly explained. CI comprises five main branches: Evolutionary Computation (EC), Swarm Intelligence (SI), Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic, and Artificial Immune Systems. A focus is laid on EC and SI as the most prominent CI methods used in logistics and supply chain management. EC is coupled with Evolutionary Algorithms (EA). Methods belonging to EC respectively EA are Evolution Strategy, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Genetic and Evolutionary Programming, the multiobjective variants Non-dominated Sorting GA (NSGA) and Strength Pareto EA (SPEA), Memetic Algorithms, and further methods. The most important methods belonging to SI are Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Discrete PSO and Ant Colony Optimization. EA and SI approaches are also attributed to the class of metaheuristics which use general problem-solving concepts for problem solution during their search for better solutions in a wide range of application domains. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",,,,,"Springer New York LLC",08848289,,,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981534911

For the same reason, various schemes of direct sale or distribution of local agricultural products have been increasingly developed as an alternative to large-scale distribution of nationally or globally sourced products. However, for a variety of vegetable crops such as salads and leaves, there is few scientific evidence about the relative environmental performance of alternative farming techniques. Similarly, alternative distribution systems have mainly been investigated only in terms of their energy and climate change performance, and mostly within the debate on domestic/local versus imported/delocalised food supply. In this paper, life cycle assessment (LCA) was used to compare the potential environmental impacts of two agricultural supply chains, with the primary aim of testing the expected benefits of vegetable organic farming and of alternative forms of distribution promoting packaging reduction and a shortened supply chain. Organic and integrated production of endive (Cichorium endivia) in Lombardia (northern Italy) were firstly compared, according to a cradle-to-farm gate approach. The comparison was then extended to the whole supply chain, considering the direct distribution of raw organic endive to local networks of ethical purchasing groups by means of returnable crates, and the large-scale retailing of conventional endive as a ready-to-use product after its industrial cutting, washing and packing. Fourteen environmental and human health impact categories were considered as terms of comparison, along with the cumulative energy demand. Results revealed that none of the examined farming techniques has a better overall environmental profile. In fact, when impacts are expressed per hectare of cultivated area, nearly half impact categories (7/15) are favourable to organic farming, with impact reductions ranging from 13% to 55%. However, organic fertilisation practices are responsible for higher impacts of this cultivation form in terms of acidification (+16%), terrestrial eutrophication (+32%) and non-carcinogenic human toxicity (+127%). Per kg of harvested product, impact categories favourable to organic farming are reduced to five, while six are favourable to integrated farming (which achieves higher yields). Organic farming techniques thus need to be further improved in terms of fertilisation practices and achievable yields in order to achieve a more sustainable production system. Considering the whole supply chain, the direct distribution of the raw organic product loose at the local level is preferable for all impact categories except one, where the impact of the farming stage is dominant and against organic production. This exception however disappears if farming is excluded from the comparison (i.e. only distribution and consumption are considered). Observed reductions in overall supply chain impacts range mostly between 20% and 48% and are mainly enabled by the absence of disposable packaging items and industrial processing. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Integrated production; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Local food; Organic farming; Packaging reduction; Short supply chain","Agricultural products; Agriculture; Climate change; Cultivation; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Eutrophication; Food supply; Purchasing; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Vegetables; Integrated production; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Local foods; Organic farming; Short supply; Life cycle",,"Nessi, S.; Politecnico di Milano, Italy; email: simone.nessi@polimi.it","Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979665376

As a result there is an increasing focus on green aspects of the supply chain to reduce environmental impacts and ensure environmental efficiency. This is largely driven by changes made in government rules and regulations with which organizations must comply in order to successfully operate in different regions of the world. Therefore, manufacturing organizations are striving hard to implement environmentally efficient supply chains while simultaneously maximizing their profit to compete in the market. To address the issue, this research studies a forward-reverse logistics model. This paper puts forward a model of a multi-period, multi-echelon, vehicle routing, forward-reverse logistics system. The network considered in the model assumes a fixed number of suppliers, facilities, distributors, customer zones, disassembly locations, re-distributors and second customer zones. The demand levels at customer zones are assumed to be deterministic. The objective of the paper is to maximize the total expected profit and also to obtain an efficient route for the vehicle corresponding to an optimal/near optimal solution. The proposed model is resolved using Artificial Immune System (AIS) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms. The findings show that for the considered model, AIS works better than the PSO.

However, insufficient investment and inefficient supply chains have hampered the viability of reuse and/or recycling because of the extended time intervals between the recycling process of recovery and reuse. Manufacturers and distributors face the challenge and necessity to reduce these process delays in order to recover the maximum value of the returned products through an effective, responsive closed loop supply chain (CLSC). This paper quantitatively measures the effective responsiveness of the CLSC model in terms of time and energy efficiency. The proposed multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MOMILP) model evaluates delay parameters with decision variables that maximize profit, optimize customer surplus and minimize energy use. The model suggests decision makers may achieve an optimal tradeoff among differing objectives in a multiple-objective CLSC scenario. We employed a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) approach to solve the proposed MOMILP model and compared our approach with the Non-Dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) for optimal solution. Results of the comparative evolutionary approaches shows that MOPSO outperforms NSGA-II in almost all cases in achieving the best trade-off solutions. Sensitivity analysis carried out to test the robustness of the model confirms that substantially less cost is feasible through the reduction of return process delays. This paper aims to formulate a multi-objective CLSC problem based on a network-flow model measuring the time value to recover maximum assets lost due to delay at different stages of the recycle process. We also developed a particle swarm approach for a multi-objective CLSC. Our study also offers valuable insights for designers wishing to create a product flow network with an optimal capacity level in case of prioritized objectives scenarios. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Closed loop supply chain; Multi-objective particle swarm optimization; Product recovery; Time-sensitive product returns","Computer system recovery; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Investments; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Recycling; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chain networks; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); Insufficient investments; Mixed integer linear programming; Multi objective particle swarm optimization; Product recovery; Product returns; Multiobjective optimization","2011B1006","Subramanian, N.; Nottingham University Business School China, 199 Taikang East Road, China; email: nachiappan.subramanian@nottingham.edu.cn","Elsevier B.V.",09255273,,IJPCE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973131343

The Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) performance is directly related to the CLSC network design. The CLSC network design, with long-term and strategic connotations, involves selection of an integrated network of partner organizations to be engaged on one hand in the forward supply chain processes relevant to families of existing and new products and also involved in reverse supply chain activities relevant to reconstruction of the returned products. At the tactical level, Closed-Loop Supply Chain Configuration (CLSCC) attempts to address issues pertinent to launch of a new product and its reconstruction. The CLSC network design is well studied in the current literature, but addressing the CLSCC is neglected. To study the CLSCC problem we: (a) develop an integrated optimization model for problem; (b) present a real-world case study of a battery manufacturer; (c) based on the case study, we conduct a comprehensive set of computational experiments followed by a series of what-if analyses to compare profitability of the Forward Supply Chain Configuration (FSCC) versus the CLSCC; and (c) discuss the key observations and managerial implications drawn from the computational experiments, applicable to other real-world instances. The significant outcomes of the study suggest that: (i) performance of the firm׳s base case integrated CLSCC model is significantly better than the current supply chain model (ii) the sales-price ratio of new battery is found to be negatively related with the maximum acquiring price of used batteries; (iii) combination of sales price ratios of new and reconditioned batteries determines the total net profit for a given return rate.

The consumers at the demand markets reflect their preferences through the demand price functions, which depend on the product demands and on the average level of cybersecurity in the supply chain network. We identify the supply chain network vulnerability to cyberattacks as well as that of the individual retailers. We demonstrate that the governing Nash equilibrium conditions can be formulated as a variational inequality problem and we provide a novel alternative formulation, along with the accompanying theory. We also propose an algorithm for the alternative formulation, which yields, at each iteration, closed form expressions in product transactions, security levels, and Lagrange multipliers associated with the budget constraints. We then apply the algorithm to compute solutions to a spectrum of numerical supply chain network cybersecurity investment examples.

Weighted mean-risk objectives by using different risk measures and minimax objective are examined to obtain risk-averse and robust solutions, respectively. Computational results are presented on a real-life case study to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approaches. To compare these different decision-making situations, a simulation approach is used. Furthermore, by several test problems, the performance of the stochastic model is investigated and the scenario generation method is evaluated in terms of in-sample and out-of-sample stability.

To do this, we develop two mixed integer nonlinear (MINL) lean and responsive models for a four-tier SC to understand these four strategies: i) holding back-up emergency stocks at the DCs, ii) holding back-up emergency stock for transshipment to all DCs at a strategic DC (for risk pooling in the SC), iii) reserving excess capacity in the facilities, and iv) using other facilities in the SC's network to back-up the primary facilities. A new method for designing the network is developed which works based on the definition of path to cover all possible disturbances. To solve the two proposed MINL models, a linear regression approximation is suggested to linearize the models; this technique works based on a piecewise linear transformation. The efficiency of the solution technique is tested for two prevalent distribution functions. We then explore how these models operate using empirical data from an automotive SC. This enables us to develop a more comprehensive risk mitigation framework than previous studies and show how it can be used to determine the optimal SC design and risk mitigation strategies given the uncertainties faced by practitioners and the performance objectives they wish to meet. © 2015","Network design; Responsiveness; Risk management; Robust optimization; Supply chain management","Distribution functions; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Optimization; Piecewise linear techniques; Risk management; Supply chain management; Comprehensive risks; Network design; Performance objective; Piecewise-linear transformation; Regression approximation; Responsiveness; Risk mitigation strategy; Robust optimization; Design",,"Farahani, R.Z.; Department of Management, United Kingdom; email: Zanjiranireza@gmail.com","Elsevier B.V.",09255273,,IJPCE,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949983690
